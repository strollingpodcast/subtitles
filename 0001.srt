1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,779
If you involve yourself with all the
little bits of food that you have in

2
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:08,210
your fridge and you create a delicious
meal out of it, this is a work of art.

3
00:00:13,286 --> 00:00:14,336
Welcome to Strolling.

4
00:00:15,036 --> 00:00:19,746
I'm Rosano here with Judy Perly, owner
of Toronto's Free times cafe, which

5
00:00:19,746 --> 00:00:23,586
has been serving authentic Jewish and
middle Eastern food for over 40 years

6
00:00:23,826 --> 00:00:28,026
while also functioning as a hub for
folk music in the city, with live shows

7
00:00:28,026 --> 00:00:31,506
during the week and a songwriter open
stage that's been running for decades.

8
00:00:31,842 --> 00:00:34,512
What struck me from our exchange
was her spirit of usefulness,

9
00:00:34,512 --> 00:00:36,852
curiosity and freedom at 71 years.

10
00:00:37,062 --> 00:00:39,672
the connections between
everything become apparent with

11
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:41,137
her holistic view of the world.

12
00:00:41,437 --> 00:00:45,217
Making it effortless to jump from
food, to art, to politics, to life.

13
00:00:45,577 --> 00:00:49,387
Despite recording at the tail end of an
exhausting day, her presence with me was

14
00:00:49,387 --> 00:00:51,217
lively, generous, and sharp as a knife.

15
00:00:51,757 --> 00:00:53,677
It's a privilege to have
Judy as my first guest.

16
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:55,987
So without further ado, let's get into it.

17
00:00:57,429 --> 00:01:00,579
Judy, welcome to the podcast
and thanks for being here.

18
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:02,409
Oh, thank you.

19
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:03,979
What do most people know you for?

20
00:01:04,424 --> 00:01:08,034
They know me as the owner of free
times cafe on college street,

21
00:01:08,144 --> 00:01:09,854
no me for other things too.

22
00:01:09,854 --> 00:01:15,474
Like, you know, my yoga friends know
me as a yogini and people know me from

23
00:01:15,474 --> 00:01:21,654
part of a group of people that swim,
My identity and the present is from my

24
00:01:21,654 --> 00:01:23,784
well-known business free times cafe.

25
00:01:23,861 --> 00:01:30,041
And I'm known as the local yid
in downtown Toronto, the one

26
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:32,051
that represents Jewish culture.

27
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:33,721
Right, And it's been like that for awhile.

28
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:34,201
I imagined.

29
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:34,951
Yeah.

30
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:39,571
For like 25 years the Jewish
part and on the free times for

31
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:42,511
like over 40 years, 40 years.

32
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:43,111
Yeah.

33
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:47,011
And where are you at right now?

34
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:48,271
What do you mean?

35
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:48,961
Where am I at?

36
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:50,441
After 40 years, what do you do?

37
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:52,151
Do you just shut it down?

38
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:55,541
Like I emote, every day
I rant about something.

39
00:01:55,924 --> 00:01:59,684
I conceptualize I try to see
the world in a bigger picture.

40
00:01:59,894 --> 00:02:03,494
I don't agree with most of
the status quo of things.

41
00:02:03,574 --> 00:02:07,354
I worry about the state of the
world and very concerned in the bill

42
00:02:07,354 --> 00:02:09,034
of goods is been sold to people.

43
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:10,581
What's the bill of goods?

44
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:17,451
The bill of goods is this
fearful negative view of life.

45
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:19,851
This limiting negative view of life.

46
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:22,561
And COVID is just a symptom of that.

47
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:26,016
And that was just part of his
ongoing negative view, which

48
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:27,846
started when I was young.

49
00:02:27,846 --> 00:02:29,286
And I was a teacher in that.

50
00:02:29,286 --> 00:02:34,976
And I left teaching when I was 26 because
I found the system so hypocritical

51
00:02:36,895 --> 00:02:38,755
weren't really interested in teaching.

52
00:02:38,805 --> 00:02:42,915
The main topic of conversation in
the staff room was the pension,

53
00:02:43,168 --> 00:02:45,808
the mortgage, and the racist jokes.

54
00:02:46,012 --> 00:02:47,782
And I always wanted more.

55
00:02:47,782 --> 00:02:53,530
I wanted to be more in this world having
one more authentic life and to be free.

56
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,930
I always strove to feel free.

57
00:02:56,917 --> 00:03:01,212
And, you know, I was an artist and I
wanted to reinvent myself every time.

58
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,030
And I got into cooking and then I
just cooked my way through life.

59
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,607
I was given the gift of cooking.

60
00:03:08,952 --> 00:03:11,712
You've had my food and whatever I cook.

61
00:03:11,712 --> 00:03:12,342
It's good.

62
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:14,832
And I never know what it's going to be.

63
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:18,772
The food speaks to me and
tells me what to do with it.

64
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:22,672
So it sounds like food is not
just a nutritional thing for you.

65
00:03:22,672 --> 00:03:25,002
Like what, what does it
mean ? Is it like a social thing?

66
00:03:25,002 --> 00:03:26,412
Is it like a magical thing?

67
00:03:26,412 --> 00:03:28,212
Is it like a artistic thing?

68
00:03:28,212 --> 00:03:28,362
Like

69
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:32,342
It's a soul thing for me,  cooking
makes my soul feel good.

70
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:37,622
You know, when I cook, I feel good if I
don't feel good and I cook, I feel good.

71
00:03:38,162 --> 00:03:39,242
So it's my cure.

72
00:03:39,827 --> 00:03:41,357
It's the cure for my soul.

73
00:03:42,258 --> 00:03:45,128
I  feel people are cooking
at home less and less today.

74
00:03:45,548 --> 00:03:46,118
Do you think that's okay.

75
00:03:46,148 --> 00:03:46,928
Well, it was cold.

76
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,838
People started cooking more, but
they're getting all this prepared

77
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:52,718
stuff in boxes and it tells you
what to do and this and that.

78
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:55,868
And I don't necessarily agree with it.

79
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:59,528
I'm not saying it's entirely
wrong, but cooking is much

80
00:03:59,528 --> 00:04:01,178
easier than people think it is.

81
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:07,628
Oh, you just need to have a few of
the right utensils, but not too many.

82
00:04:08,198 --> 00:04:12,188
people complicate cooking and
they complicate it with recipes.

83
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,598
I'm somewhat against recipes.

84
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:17,108
Yea, you convinced me
to stop using recipes.

85
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:21,428
And that totally changed my relationship
with, I think I became a chef in some

86
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:26,378
sense, like, because, or I just tell
you that to stop using investigates,

87
00:04:26,408 --> 00:04:30,751
you told me go to the supermarket,
buy whatever you like, take a carrot

88
00:04:30,751 --> 00:04:31,801
and just bite it, just eat it.

89
00:04:31,831 --> 00:04:33,451
Like it just tasted directly.

90
00:04:33,451 --> 00:04:36,331
And then you start to get a sense
of the flavors and the tastes.

91
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:38,341
And that, that really happened for me.

92
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:40,051
It was like, oh, okay.

93
00:04:40,261 --> 00:04:41,431
And I totally didn't think that was.

94
00:04:42,091 --> 00:04:45,901
But yeah, it like over time, it's like,
oh, actually I kind of liked that.

95
00:04:45,901 --> 00:04:48,961
I like when it's cut like this,
I like this when it's with that.

96
00:04:49,381 --> 00:04:49,771
Right.

97
00:04:49,981 --> 00:04:52,021
And you don't have to cut
it the same way every time.

98
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:55,471
And every time when I cook, I don't
necessarily make the things the same.

99
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:58,651
Like when I make meat sauce, every
time I make it, it's different.

100
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:00,211
It's not exactly the same.

101
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:01,381
Why should it be?

102
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:06,481
Yeah, you see, this is the thing of north
America, where we mass produce things.

103
00:05:06,511 --> 00:05:07,171
The same.

104
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:11,671
We have this, this idea that
everything has to be the same.

105
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:15,781
Or it has to be the there's the
expert, the idea of the expert

106
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:17,281
and the expert has the recipe.

107
00:05:17,581 --> 00:05:21,091
And if you follow the recipe
of the expert, you will have

108
00:05:21,091 --> 00:05:23,491
achieved expertise yourself.

109
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:24,331
Not true.

110
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,031
It's kind of a new idea.

111
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:30,871
I guess, though, you can buy experience
or expertise or something like that.

112
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:34,481
maybe a hundred or two years, a
hundred years ago, like you would

113
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:39,641
have had to have the experience in
order to achieve a certain thing.

114
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:43,991
Look, women were cooking for thousands
of years and getting no credit for it.

115
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:48,431
Every family had a personal chef
and we didn't call it that we

116
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,101
just called it your mother, right.

117
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:52,961
Some were better than others.

118
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:56,021
Pretty well every family
had a personal chef.

119
00:05:57,611 --> 00:05:59,441
Think about it in today's world.

120
00:06:00,671 --> 00:06:04,421
It's a rarity that, that, you know,
you're going to get all your meals

121
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,496
cooked by somebody there in the house.

122
00:06:07,526 --> 00:06:07,856
Right.

123
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:09,116
They might cook some of them.

124
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:14,150
You, yeah, but some very beautiful
things are done through food.

125
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,360
Food was my, my go-to and it still is.

126
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,290
There was a time in my life
where I was so unhappy.

127
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,840
The only time I was happy
was when I was cooking.

128
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:27,209
So, you know, cooking as a
therapy is, is, is strong.

129
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:29,099
I think it's a wonderful thing to do.

130
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:33,899
I mean, we need to take people with mental
health issues and get them into cooking

131
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:39,569
and not just in these institutionalized
kitchens, these big kitchens.

132
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:40,019
No.

133
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:43,019
Mental health has to be something
in people's homes, you know,

134
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:44,339
it has to be matched up.

135
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:51,039
I feel like people don't think about food
is a cure for mental health specifically.

136
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,749
Like how do you see that connection?

137
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:57,299
Well, the process of
it is very therapeutic.

138
00:06:57,299 --> 00:07:00,329
You know, we're involved
with creating something.

139
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:03,689
Creation is always satisfying.

140
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:10,919
And you need to eat your
nourishing yourself, keeping

141
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:12,839
your energy up good health.

142
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,979
And it's very social.

143
00:07:14,549 --> 00:07:17,039
Somebody who knows how to
cook is going to have friends.

144
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:18,599
People are going to
want to be around them.

145
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:20,249
They're going to want
to go to their house.

146
00:07:20,429 --> 00:07:23,519
Maybe if they're not very verbal
or they don't have greatest person.

147
00:07:24,374 --> 00:07:27,194
They can at least cook a meal
and people want to be there.

148
00:07:27,974 --> 00:07:29,294
It's something to offer.

149
00:07:29,444 --> 00:07:30,704
And it's a giving thing.

150
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:32,954
You're giving it to other people.

151
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:34,521
You can learn generosity.

152
00:07:34,571 --> 00:07:37,361
But we need to eat to live.

153
00:07:37,511 --> 00:07:38,711
And it's so basic.

154
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:40,061
We get hungry.

155
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:41,081
We need to eat.

156
00:07:41,681 --> 00:07:46,061
And if you involve yourself with all
the little bits of food that you have in

157
00:07:46,061 --> 00:07:51,071
your fridge and you create a delicious
meal out of it, this is a work of art.

158
00:07:51,401 --> 00:07:52,631
And it's very satisfying.

159
00:07:52,811 --> 00:07:58,541
We forget that a lot of mental health
issues have nothing to do with our brains.

160
00:07:58,691 --> 00:08:03,011
They have to do with our souls and we
have forgotten what a soul is in this

161
00:08:03,011 --> 00:08:07,181
world, you know, and the soul is not
your body and it's not your brain.

162
00:08:07,871 --> 00:08:13,681
It's the flow of your life in your
brain and your body, it's like

163
00:08:13,681 --> 00:08:15,871
who you are and where you take it.

164
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:17,401
And it's everything combined.

165
00:08:17,401 --> 00:08:19,681
Everything put together is your soul.

166
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:23,437
But we've compartmentalized and
we've really killed the soul.

167
00:08:23,527 --> 00:08:25,987
And this is why we have so
many mental health issues.

168
00:08:26,197 --> 00:08:27,907
Because we've lost connection with soul.

169
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:28,267
Yeah.

170
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:29,629
Thomas Moore.

171
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:30,199
Okay.

172
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,719
Not the English writer, but
this is American philosopher.

173
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,539
He said the soul likes small things.

174
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:38,779
And that sentence changed my life.

175
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:43,745
So whenever you are unhappy, for
whatever reason, you don't know

176
00:08:43,745 --> 00:08:45,395
why I don't feel good today.

177
00:08:45,425 --> 00:08:46,865
I'm unhappy, I'm anxious.

178
00:08:46,865 --> 00:08:47,945
I'm angry on this.

179
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:48,455
I'm that.

180
00:08:49,205 --> 00:08:54,425
And you know, you engage in some
small activity like sweeping the floor

181
00:08:54,425 --> 00:08:56,255
or wiping off a table or something.

182
00:08:56,255 --> 00:09:01,625
Just the involvement in that
small activity can sooth the soul.

183
00:09:02,115 --> 00:09:07,335
Women traditionally have been
involved in these mundane acts.

184
00:09:07,815 --> 00:09:12,525
So people talk of their
mothers in a different way than

185
00:09:12,525 --> 00:09:13,785
they do with their fathers.

186
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:18,315
And they often see their mothers as
having more soul in their fathers.

187
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:22,425
And I think it's mainly because
the women were relegated to doing

188
00:09:22,425 --> 00:09:28,335
these small tasks and actually in
a way that was their liberation.

189
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,510
You mentioned wanting to be free earlier.

190
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,460
How do you feel today?

191
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,090
Do you feel free?

192
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,640
Yeah, I do pretty free.

193
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,480
Not completely free, but I
feel freer than I've ever felt.

194
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:42,900
I'd say.

195
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:47,617
I mean, you have a lot of
things to do every week.

196
00:09:47,617 --> 00:09:49,087
You have a restaurant you're managing it.

197
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:53,077
Some people would say that's being tied
down or you have commitments or whatever,

198
00:09:53,497 --> 00:09:56,167
but you feel free in spite of all of this.

199
00:09:56,827 --> 00:09:57,187
Yeah.

200
00:09:57,217 --> 00:10:00,697
But having those commitments and
having to get up and go somewhere,

201
00:10:00,907 --> 00:10:02,347
it's just kind of ordinary.

202
00:10:03,307 --> 00:10:07,447
But feeling really free is
something that you earn over time.

203
00:10:07,867 --> 00:10:12,797
You know, that's like clearing out, hiring
the organizer and decluttering, you know,

204
00:10:12,797 --> 00:10:14,867
that's years and years of decluttering.

205
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,597
Well, this is what I mean, because it
seems like you're not talking about some

206
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:22,707
purely logistical thing of like, having
time, for example, because you don't

207
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:25,930
really, I mean, you're busy, and I think
that's what people associate with freedom.

208
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,310
It's like, oh, I have the time.

209
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,980
Or maybe I'm like filthy
rich or something like that.

210
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,680
But it means something other
than that, I do have time.

211
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,460
I take time.

212
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,380
Like I take three hours in the morning.

213
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,070
Sometimes I lie in bed for an
hour before I get out of bed.

214
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:44,590
I take the time to have the time,
have a nice bed in my, in my bed.

215
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,622
I don't clutter my life
is a lot of busy work.

216
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:56,052
actually in Cove, I felt more free in
many ways because I had my nights free and

217
00:10:56,112 --> 00:10:57,942
didn't have to relate to so many people.

218
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:01,462
It was so nice to come home and cook
dinner for myself every night and have

219
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:10,325
all this delicious and then to give it
to others That's one, one part of it,

220
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:16,505
you know, doing yoga, hired my yoga
teacher, two classes of yoga for like the

221
00:11:16,505 --> 00:11:18,545
last year and a bed that's been amazing.

222
00:11:18,848 --> 00:11:23,168
But feeling free is a state of being,
you know, it's not a situation.

223
00:11:24,522 --> 00:11:30,342
The only thing that would drive me crazy
would be,  I could be locked up in a

224
00:11:30,342 --> 00:11:38,085
room, but noise would drive me crazy, like
constant, loud rock music or a constant

225
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:40,905
loud noise that would drive me crazy.

226
00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:45,435
Or if I have to eat really awful
food, all that would be hard.

227
00:11:45,615 --> 00:11:51,285
But if it was very plain food, I would
be okay with it, like real food that was

228
00:11:51,285 --> 00:11:57,466
playing, like, let's say plain boiled
potatoes, what's awful, you know, packaged

229
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:03,016
food phones, you know, commercial,
food, commercial food, the chemicals.

230
00:12:03,106 --> 00:12:04,216
It's not really food.

231
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:05,858
What are you close minded about?

232
00:12:06,838 --> 00:12:12,658
Ooh, close minded about,  I think I'm
close minded about people who aren't,

233
00:12:12,658 --> 00:12:15,478
risk-takers, too careful in their lives.

234
00:12:15,798 --> 00:12:16,438
I've talked with that.

235
00:12:18,026 --> 00:12:22,286
Close minded about people who
are in relationships for ulterior

236
00:12:22,286 --> 00:12:28,316
motives, like for money or for
status people that use other pupil.

237
00:12:28,316 --> 00:12:32,486
I'm pretty close minded about
materialistic people to the extreme.

238
00:12:32,896 --> 00:12:34,546
Not that I don't like things, I do.

239
00:12:34,856 --> 00:12:39,206
Not that I don't have friends that will
spend lots of money, uncles, but people

240
00:12:39,206 --> 00:12:43,526
who are not generous, I'm pretty close
minded about people who are selfish.

241
00:12:44,668 --> 00:12:48,438
It's interesting that you're always
referencing people as opposed to some

242
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:54,958
kind of ideology or a school of thought
or something, or just a way to, oh yeah.

243
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:55,914
Cool.

244
00:12:56,004 --> 00:12:56,214
Yeah.

245
00:12:56,214 --> 00:13:01,635
I'm pretty closed minded about,
letting people starve, and out and

246
00:13:01,635 --> 00:13:04,215
wars I'm completely against wars.

247
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:09,600
Letting people starve has something to do
with food waste for you also, other than,

248
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,020
you know,  taking care of one another.

249
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:17,308
I mean, it seems like a topic that all
absolutely shameful and we're the worst

250
00:13:17,368 --> 00:13:19,888
culprits in the world, north America.

251
00:13:19,918 --> 00:13:20,338
Yeah.

252
00:13:20,548 --> 00:13:21,898
But there's no penalty on it.

253
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,790
Well, whatever, you know, there's
no penalty for food waste, We waste

254
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:33,310
by 40% of all food, but I'm not
talking about dumpster diving either.

255
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,020
I'm not in favor of dumpster diving.

256
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,500
Not that I would say
judge people who do it.

257
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,440
Cause I can understand doing, I
really can, but the fact that we put

258
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:48,010
all this food in the dumpster, in
the first place, that's the problem.

259
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:48,370
Right.

260
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:48,820
Right.

261
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:54,586
In this whole, before due date, things
is an artificial manufacturer because

262
00:13:54,586 --> 00:13:56,566
that was just a way to move more product.

263
00:13:56,596 --> 00:13:58,126
It's not necessarily that.

264
00:13:58,726 --> 00:13:59,956
Oh yeah, yeah.

265
00:14:00,346 --> 00:14:05,986
Actually we just did that so they could
keep the shelves full and somebody could

266
00:14:05,986 --> 00:14:07,696
buy it and it was still last at home.

267
00:14:07,906 --> 00:14:11,716
So they would just take the stuff that was
two or three days and just throw it up.

268
00:14:12,525 --> 00:14:16,365
You know, now people are getting
interested in these best before last day

269
00:14:16,365 --> 00:14:20,414
and then people are buying them more and
more because food is expensive, but we

270
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:27,758
got to stop this wastage and selfishness
around food and extravagance around food.

271
00:14:28,204 --> 00:14:28,534
Right?

272
00:14:30,394 --> 00:14:30,904
Yeah.

273
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:34,924
That everything has to be fancy
that we eat, you know, that you

274
00:14:34,924 --> 00:14:38,674
can't eat rice and beans and
simple food and feel good about it.

275
00:14:39,048 --> 00:14:43,308
Not that I eat that much rice and
beans, but at my age is not maybe

276
00:14:43,308 --> 00:14:44,528
the best food for me to be eating.

277
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:50,606
And I'm very pissed about
bad health being the norm.

278
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:51,508
No.

279
00:14:51,508 --> 00:15:00,114
I'm very pissed that of all the money that
comes into Ontario spent on healthcare.

280
00:15:00,534 --> 00:15:04,494
So if you had a family doing that,
let's say the family earned a hundred

281
00:15:04,494 --> 00:15:08,724
thousand dollars a year and they
spent 60,000 of it on healthcare.

282
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:10,584
You say, well, what's wrong.

283
00:15:10,854 --> 00:15:11,784
What's wrong with you?

284
00:15:11,964 --> 00:15:13,464
There's something wrong here.

285
00:15:13,965 --> 00:15:16,755
Why are you spending $60,000 in any base?

286
00:15:17,265 --> 00:15:20,415
Barely have money for food,
housing and everything else?

287
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:26,536
Well, this is, this is our society
and the way we treat elders and in

288
00:15:26,536 --> 00:15:31,364
many ways, the way we treat children,
micro-managing them imprisoning them.

289
00:15:32,044 --> 00:15:35,704
I think I'm against the norm of
society, the norms of society.

290
00:15:35,884 --> 00:15:39,034
I think everyone liked the
norm and I hate the Cove norm.

291
00:15:39,034 --> 00:15:44,971
I think it's a  bill of goods that has
been sold to people and the problem

292
00:15:45,241 --> 00:15:50,341
coves spread because of inherent social
problems that we had before COVID started.

293
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:53,091
It's like tuberculosis.

294
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:57,197
There were social problems that
existed that spread to tuberculosis.

295
00:15:57,607 --> 00:16:03,607
Lack of proper housing damn
posing, cold housing, no heat.

296
00:16:04,957 --> 00:16:07,337
That's what spread tuberculosis.

297
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:12,055
The way we treat our elders, the
way we treat immigrants, the way

298
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:16,885
we treat people who worked in
factories, that's what spread.

299
00:16:17,035 --> 00:16:18,167
Oh, okay.

300
00:16:18,237 --> 00:16:21,587
The conditions by which we
force these people to live under

301
00:16:22,005 --> 00:16:24,465
created a certain kind of outcome.

302
00:16:24,795 --> 00:16:24,915
Okay.

303
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:31,005
And also their immune system
being worn down from eating

304
00:16:31,005 --> 00:16:32,655
crappy food, not taken by him.

305
00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:37,035
There's nobody ever wants on TV,
talked about keeping your immune

306
00:16:37,035 --> 00:16:39,405
system strong to prevent getting Cove.

307
00:16:40,157 --> 00:16:41,597
So what is a human being?

308
00:16:41,597 --> 00:16:43,907
What is our bottom line about being human?

309
00:16:45,006 --> 00:16:49,206
That's what, the questions that we
have to ask . So I'm a hypocrite.

310
00:16:49,506 --> 00:16:57,242
I don't say my true feelings all the
time because I can't, but I do  with

311
00:16:57,242 --> 00:16:59,029
my staff . And they agree with me.

312
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:00,409
I tell them, they're lucky.

313
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:00,919
They're lucky.

314
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:01,939
I'm not crazy.

315
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:02,989
Okay.

316
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:05,959
I remember in the height of Cove, I
went to the island with my girlfriend

317
00:17:06,379 --> 00:17:08,419
and I put my purse on the ground.

318
00:17:08,749 --> 00:17:12,079
She says, don't, it could get cold.

319
00:17:12,139 --> 00:17:13,279
I've got a sidewalk.

320
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:15,349
How was it going to live on a sidewalk?

321
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:15,949
You tell me.

322
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,829
Anyway, so what is that time you is
telling you that there is this inherent

323
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:27,069
fear that we've all been brought up
with that was there before COVID.

324
00:17:27,732 --> 00:17:29,362
Why was I not afraid?

325
00:17:29,362 --> 00:17:30,892
Because I was very lucky.

326
00:17:30,892 --> 00:17:36,922
I was somewhat neglected and brought
up in laneways on a main street and the

327
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:39,682
1950s and sixties and allowed to run free.

328
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:45,232
And I had a father who was
a free spirit and a outlier.

329
00:17:45,682 --> 00:17:49,382
I didn't believe in the status
quo and taught me how to think.

330
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:55,145
And the other thing is that we all
have to accept is nobody cares.

331
00:17:55,464 --> 00:17:59,184
In the end, you better do it for
yourself because nobody's going to care.

332
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:01,284
They will try to care.

333
00:18:01,434 --> 00:18:03,294
And when you seek help, you may get it.

334
00:18:03,864 --> 00:18:06,834
But for your core life,
you better do a future.

335
00:18:07,464 --> 00:18:10,584
You're saying society as a
whole doesn't care about you.

336
00:18:11,034 --> 00:18:11,334
Yeah.

337
00:18:12,054 --> 00:18:13,564
Like you have to take care of yourself.

338
00:18:13,564 --> 00:18:19,704
Yeah, our society helps a little bit, but
they, with one hand they take it away.

339
00:18:19,704 --> 00:18:21,024
And the other hand they give it to you.

340
00:18:21,407 --> 00:18:26,177
I feel like . Look at Rosano traveling
around the world in the last five years.

341
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,620
You made the money to take
care of yourself to do it.

342
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,980
You had your way of looking at the world.

343
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,910
You made your connections in
the way that you wanted to . you

344
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,700
didn't look to the government of
Canada to make it happen for you.

345
00:18:38,136 --> 00:18:43,773
I kind of feel like my situation was
a consequence of like the freedom that

346
00:18:43,773 --> 00:18:47,463
I had to not live in society as it is.

347
00:18:47,788 --> 00:18:53,058
But that is the gift of a middle-class
upbringing and an education.

348
00:18:54,298 --> 00:18:55,948
You did in the right way.

349
00:18:55,948 --> 00:18:59,758
And I did too in that we were
not particularly materialistic.

350
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:05,728
So that's the real gift of a
civilized societies to give

351
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:08,038
people individual freedom.

352
00:19:08,758 --> 00:19:14,398
We talk about that, but in fact, we're not
doing that because we're molding people

353
00:19:14,398 --> 00:19:21,274
into consumers who value materialism and
are full of fear and they're not brave.

354
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:25,144
And they haven't gone out there in
the world and done it themselves

355
00:19:25,384 --> 00:19:30,941
and created that really core
confidence and be ready to die.

356
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:33,361
I don't give a shit if I die.

357
00:19:33,391 --> 00:19:38,745
I'm afraid of a bad accident and,
and having horrific injuries from a

358
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,935
bad accident, I'm not afraid to die.

359
00:19:41,715 --> 00:19:47,985
I could die to the world, so I've
lived my life, but I'm afraid if

360
00:19:47,985 --> 00:19:51,285
I had a horrible accident, that
would be much worse than dying.

361
00:19:54,135 --> 00:19:55,125
What are you afraid of?

362
00:19:58,825 --> 00:19:59,595
You think about that?

363
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:04,026
I feel like I worry a lot, but
I don't know if that's because

364
00:20:04,026 --> 00:20:07,886
I'm afraid necessarily, or maybe
I'm just being paranoid, but like

365
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:11,106
really genuinely fear full of stuff.

366
00:20:11,682 --> 00:20:12,612
What do you worry about?

367
00:20:13,772 --> 00:20:16,642
I'm constantly, I don't know
this is going to work out.

368
00:20:16,642 --> 00:20:19,012
I don't know if I have
enough money after the year.

369
00:20:19,012 --> 00:20:21,352
I don't know what's going to happen
if I don't figure this thing out.

370
00:20:21,352 --> 00:20:22,702
I'm not going to have
to go on unemployment.

371
00:20:22,752 --> 00:20:27,552
It's, it's actually, it's a lot of
materialistic things, maybe lower chakra.

372
00:20:27,732 --> 00:20:29,802
It was lower chakra, very low chakra.

373
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,759
within us, we have so much power.

374
00:20:33,749 --> 00:20:39,435
Our society is just so narrow considering,
but I have hope for the future.

375
00:20:39,435 --> 00:20:41,985
I have hope for younger people,
and I have hope for women.

376
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:46,065
I think, you know, women are going
to come up really strong in a good.

377
00:20:46,921 --> 00:20:52,051
And men, you know, if the, if
the men are smart, they will too,

378
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:56,611
but you know, men have been sold
a bill of goods, unfortunately,

379
00:20:56,951 --> 00:20:58,724
and are still believing in that.

380
00:20:59,164 --> 00:21:07,094
You should take a break, you know, let us
do the heavy lifting, take a break guys.

381
00:21:08,114 --> 00:21:10,544
I think that, you know,
smart families did that.

382
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:11,574
You guys took a break.

383
00:21:12,494 --> 00:21:16,544
And these realizations, a part of what
you call the gift of getting older.

384
00:21:16,971 --> 00:21:22,328
You have hope all of a sudden or… oh, I
always was an optimistic person because

385
00:21:22,328 --> 00:21:24,338
I've actually used so many things.

386
00:21:24,438 --> 00:21:26,208
I've made so many things happen.

387
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:29,088
I mean, initiated 12,000 cultural events.

388
00:21:29,628 --> 00:21:30,978
And… Twelve thousand?

389
00:21:31,238 --> 00:21:35,178
Yea that's what Free Times
has had 12,000 over 12,000.

390
00:21:35,238 --> 00:21:35,568
Right.

391
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:40,998
I invented this fantastic brunch that
happened every week for 26 years.

392
00:21:41,538 --> 00:21:44,208
I had an art career,
I've done tons of art.

393
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:49,427
And so I've done things, but I was that
type of person, you know, I did a lot of

394
00:21:49,427 --> 00:21:51,587
what I did because I was very unhappy.

395
00:21:51,587 --> 00:21:54,737
And if it didn't do
things,  I couldn't function.

396
00:21:54,817 --> 00:21:58,567
You know, in today's where we just
drug people up, you just give them a

397
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:03,217
tranquilizers and whatever, if they're
not unhappy and it, and it disables them.

398
00:22:03,217 --> 00:22:07,267
And that, that's also the core
of our problems, too many drugs.

399
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:11,919
Not that I don't drink alcohol
and I don't have a puff, but it's

400
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,998
not like all day, every day, the
society just lets addiction go on.

401
00:22:17,028 --> 00:22:22,338
They let addiction go on until it's
it's total crisis where I've been

402
00:22:22,338 --> 00:22:26,628
dealing with the core issue, which
is that we all love people be free.

403
00:22:27,711 --> 00:22:32,741
I'm happy to see marriages not
happening as frequently as they used to.

404
00:22:32,891 --> 00:22:33,671
It's a good thing.

405
00:22:33,855 --> 00:22:37,095
Because as far as I'm concerned,
a marriage should be: what the

406
00:22:37,095 --> 00:22:41,895
five-year term you want the 10
year term five removed, renewable.

407
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:42,105
Okay.

408
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:42,765
Right.

409
00:22:43,605 --> 00:22:45,855
Should it be like, yeah,
like a mortgage, right?

410
00:22:46,444 --> 00:22:49,204
This whole idea that you're going to
meet with one person for your whole

411
00:22:49,204 --> 00:22:54,614
life creates happiness for some,
but a lot of distress for others.

412
00:22:55,664 --> 00:22:58,344
You might say removes freedom
for a bunch of people.

413
00:22:58,974 --> 00:23:03,267
Most people, think people think
there's something wrong with changing.

414
00:23:04,017 --> 00:23:08,597
To be free to change music, you have
to maybe admit that you made a mistake

415
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:11,267
or something, but it's not a mistake.

416
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:14,657
I think in the old days,
it was very hard to change.

417
00:23:15,797 --> 00:23:19,067
People lived in this class based
society and you couldn't really

418
00:23:19,067 --> 00:23:22,487
move through the classes where you
were born, was really going to stay.

419
00:23:22,487 --> 00:23:27,113
And, I remember my brother telling
me in the middle ages, the average

420
00:23:27,623 --> 00:23:32,123
person never went further than five
kilometers from where they were born.

421
00:23:32,676 --> 00:23:40,086
and Canada pre world war two was like
60, 70% rural farmers was a country

422
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:45,636
full of farmers was, was, but still
is your, you know, your Canadians who

423
00:23:45,636 --> 00:23:48,366
have roots for generations are farmers.

424
00:23:48,547 --> 00:23:52,167
I want to ask you a little bit about
tech because I find it so curious

425
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:55,973
that someone from your generation
just  seems to adapt so well to it.

426
00:23:55,973 --> 00:23:58,763
And you have your contacts in your
iPhone, and you're always like

427
00:23:58,763 --> 00:24:00,533
calling people and use social media.

428
00:24:00,533 --> 00:24:02,353
And we could talk about
your vine Starbucks.

429
00:24:02,383 --> 00:24:02,533
I see.

430
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:07,183
That's the thing with me is that
I think I'm terrible attack now.

431
00:24:07,183 --> 00:24:07,933
How old are you again?

432
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:09,643
71 71.

433
00:24:09,643 --> 00:24:09,943
Okay.

434
00:24:10,843 --> 00:24:13,573
Took me two years to download an app.

435
00:24:15,403 --> 00:24:17,953
I was so afraid to download an app.

436
00:24:17,953 --> 00:24:18,823
I would never do it.

437
00:24:19,123 --> 00:24:21,613
I still require help to do things.

438
00:24:21,613 --> 00:24:21,853
Okay.

439
00:24:21,853 --> 00:24:22,933
But I seek help.

440
00:24:23,383 --> 00:24:24,163
This is the other thing.

441
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:28,843
I understand how to process things
that you need people to teach you how

442
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:33,553
to do things, but there's a learning
curve, but a lot of people think

443
00:24:33,553 --> 00:24:36,223
that you should just be able to pick
it up and know how to do it yet.

444
00:24:36,243 --> 00:24:40,183
But maybe from that generation of
my generation needs to be taught.

445
00:24:41,353 --> 00:24:45,493
And because it's not formalized
in our society is like

446
00:24:45,493 --> 00:24:47,713
marriage and having children.

447
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:51,943
And I found nobody's formally
taught how to use an iPhone.

448
00:24:52,213 --> 00:24:54,793
So I'd have to say people who
use it, don't know how to use it.

449
00:24:55,003 --> 00:24:58,183
Especially from my generation
where it's not intuitive.

450
00:24:58,836 --> 00:25:03,672
But I was also forced because
of the requirements of my work.

451
00:25:03,871 --> 00:25:07,281
I like it because it's so much easier,
but that's the thing , you enjoy it

452
00:25:07,281 --> 00:25:11,091
ultimately and you're, you're taking
to it and you find your own way to

453
00:25:11,091 --> 00:25:12,351
sort of express yourself through it.

454
00:25:12,351 --> 00:25:16,791
And it's not like, uh, uh, it's another
new thing I got to like, you, you embrace

455
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:22,470
it more or less cause it's obviously like
a completely different social pattern.

456
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,990
Like, um, I work with
wedding younger people.

457
00:25:25,367 --> 00:25:27,587
So they'd teach me like you,

458
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:32,347
You are responsible for my vine stardom.

459
00:25:32,347 --> 00:25:34,877
It's all your fault Rosano!

460
00:25:34,927 --> 00:25:37,667
You were famous, you became a celebrity.

461
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:38,597
And that was my fault.

462
00:25:38,597 --> 00:25:40,637
I take full you and Jessie.

463
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:41,807
It was totally random.

464
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:43,907
Remember you sitting across to me St.

465
00:25:43,907 --> 00:25:47,477
Judy, I'm going to put this in
your phone, have some fun with it.

466
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:48,767
So I said, right.

467
00:25:49,127 --> 00:25:49,577
Yeah.

468
00:25:49,617 --> 00:25:49,917
Yeah.

469
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:53,687
It was you, you see the
power that you have.

470
00:25:54,707 --> 00:25:54,887
Yeah.

471
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:55,517
It's interesting.

472
00:25:55,517 --> 00:25:59,258
I mean, so you became, one of your
videos went viral totally by chance.

473
00:25:59,258 --> 00:26:03,788
And then you had this following
of like 10, 15,000 people.

474
00:26:03,818 --> 00:26:04,628
Mostly like, yeah.

475
00:26:04,658 --> 00:26:05,438
I didn't try.

476
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,328
If I had tried, I could've gotten away up.

477
00:26:07,688 --> 00:26:08,408
Could have worked it.

478
00:26:08,408 --> 00:26:09,148
I never worked it.

479
00:26:09,687 --> 00:26:13,347
I think a lot of people, if they
find that kind of success, they will

480
00:26:13,347 --> 00:26:15,027
try to grip onto it for dear life.

481
00:26:15,057 --> 00:26:18,477
And you're sort of like, you
know, vine isn't around anymore.

482
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:19,887
Fine is vine is gone.

483
00:26:19,887 --> 00:26:21,987
Now maybe people who are listening
don't even know what vine is.

484
00:26:21,987 --> 00:26:24,717
It used to be this, but she
knows that somebody actually

485
00:26:25,377 --> 00:26:27,367
tattooed on their bum Judy.

486
00:26:27,777 --> 00:26:28,437
Oh my gosh.

487
00:26:28,557 --> 00:26:28,797
Yeah.

488
00:26:29,427 --> 00:26:32,317
That's dedication the
dedication of your fans.

489
00:26:32,337 --> 00:26:32,577
Yeah.

490
00:26:33,295 --> 00:26:35,035
Most people would, would
want to like, keep it going.

491
00:26:35,035 --> 00:26:38,155
And so now there's tic talk, which is
kind of the thing that would, when you

492
00:26:38,155 --> 00:26:40,045
used to do and you don't want to do that.

493
00:26:40,045 --> 00:26:43,355
You're like, no, well, I'm kind of done
with that part of my life and you're not.

494
00:26:43,355 --> 00:26:44,475
I don't feel like it.

495
00:26:44,475 --> 00:26:47,095
And what, how do you
arrive at that conclusion?

496
00:26:47,395 --> 00:26:49,515
To not have even the curiosity?

497
00:26:49,515 --> 00:26:51,183
Because I'm onto other things.

498
00:26:51,183 --> 00:26:51,538
You're onto other things?

499
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:55,135
I'd rather be on a dating app
and exploring that as characters

500
00:26:55,885 --> 00:26:57,265
and just move on to other things.

501
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:59,385
There's lots of other
things in this world.

502
00:26:59,385 --> 00:27:01,225
Why keep doing the same
thing over and over?

503
00:27:02,714 --> 00:27:08,534
my life is very varied and I worked
as varied and I'm not a hyper person.

504
00:27:08,534 --> 00:27:12,824
Like I don't have to be
doing things all the time.

505
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:13,454
Right.

506
00:27:14,084 --> 00:27:19,244
I enjoy having two or three hours
a day of not doing anything much.

507
00:27:19,544 --> 00:27:23,354
I let enjoy sitting, thinking
you actually sit and think.

508
00:27:23,954 --> 00:27:28,364
Yeah, well, I enjoy thinking
more than anything really.

509
00:27:28,394 --> 00:27:31,094
And I talk a lot and I philosophize a lot.

510
00:27:31,604 --> 00:27:36,944
A lot of people, Mike keeps, Mike
keeps track of Judaism's Judaism.

511
00:27:38,174 --> 00:27:38,804
I think.

512
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:44,166
What do I think about, I think
about what's real and what isn't.

513
00:27:45,066 --> 00:27:45,516
What's real?

514
00:27:45,726 --> 00:27:46,656
Many things are real.

515
00:27:47,526 --> 00:27:51,396
I think about the things that don't
appear to be real, but really are real.

516
00:27:52,475 --> 00:27:52,895
Like?

517
00:27:53,655 --> 00:27:55,665
Just being in your physical self.

518
00:27:56,045 --> 00:27:56,585
The body?

519
00:27:56,695 --> 00:27:58,075
The body and such.

520
00:27:58,502 --> 00:28:00,062
affection that's real.

521
00:28:01,339 --> 00:28:02,839
Loving Feelings are real.

522
00:28:03,446 --> 00:28:04,616
Food is real.

523
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,080
And What's not real?

524
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:08,540
The suburbs, aren't real malls.

525
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,410
Aren't real.

526
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,847
I have a hard time with all that stuff.

527
00:28:11,877 --> 00:28:12,777
Why aren't they real?

528
00:28:14,187 --> 00:28:15,417
Cause they're a construct.

529
00:28:15,417 --> 00:28:18,687
They're an artificial
materialistic construct.

530
00:28:19,587 --> 00:28:20,847
I have a hard time with them.

531
00:28:20,847 --> 00:28:22,647
I have a lot of moralism around it.

532
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:26,349
It seems like it's just, people
well know that there is kind of

533
00:28:26,349 --> 00:28:30,399
a kind of a goal I guess, bombed
behind, but I don't like the suburbs.

534
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:37,089
I think dehumanizes people and not to
say that there aren't real and good

535
00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:41,559
and interesting people who live in the
suburbs, but I think most of them would

536
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:43,479
rather not be living in the suburbs.

537
00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:46,119
They do that because they
don't have other options.

538
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:47,069
It's not a choice, right.

539
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:47,979
It's not a choice.

540
00:28:47,979 --> 00:28:49,119
Especially immigrants.

541
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:54,661
Most of the centers are started by
immigrants, most would rather live in

542
00:28:54,661 --> 00:28:56,821
a livable city where they came from.

543
00:28:58,141 --> 00:29:04,731
But unfortunately that part of their lives
has been destroyed because some dominant

544
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:09,025
country made war and they became refugees.

545
00:29:09,311 --> 00:29:10,331
It's not a good thing.

546
00:29:10,691 --> 00:29:11,501
It's an awful thing.

547
00:29:12,437 --> 00:29:16,577
All of this reflection on what's real.

548
00:29:16,577 --> 00:29:17,717
And what's not real.

549
00:29:18,107 --> 00:29:20,987
You think about it within
yourself, I'm guessing.

550
00:29:20,987 --> 00:29:24,377
But, you mentioned once, like
wanting to start a therapy

551
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:26,117
practice to like help other people.

552
00:29:26,117 --> 00:29:29,837
So you want to also like bring this
out to other people and help them

553
00:29:30,107 --> 00:29:33,917
realize, like, how do you see your,
how do you imagine yourself doing that?

554
00:29:35,557 --> 00:29:38,857
Well, you know, like a lot of things
I've done in my life, my life in

555
00:29:38,857 --> 00:29:40,867
many ways has been very random.

556
00:29:41,737 --> 00:29:43,207
It's like a vine.

557
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:49,837
Like I, I only see it really happening in
a situation like I was needed to do it.

558
00:29:50,027 --> 00:29:53,827
Well, you can get a business card and
have a shtick and be like, no, it's

559
00:29:53,827 --> 00:29:56,767
just, I do it with people anyways.

560
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:57,997
Like I do it with my staff.

561
00:29:57,997 --> 00:30:00,757
I give them these front characters
that they can hide behind

562
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:06,457
and you know, they feel a lot
better about their insecurities.

563
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:08,347
Can you give some examples?

564
00:30:08,587 --> 00:30:10,147
Well, you know, I'm Ms.

565
00:30:10,147 --> 00:30:11,767
Critical, critical.

566
00:30:11,797 --> 00:30:12,217
Yeah.

567
00:30:12,397 --> 00:30:14,197
Tiffany is Ms.

568
00:30:14,197 --> 00:30:15,097
Overconfident.

569
00:30:15,197 --> 00:30:15,527
Mike's.

570
00:30:15,537 --> 00:30:15,827
Mr.

571
00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:18,127
Nice guy, Ravi is Mr.

572
00:30:18,467 --> 00:30:19,997
Do it myself, Sandra.

573
00:30:19,997 --> 00:30:20,537
And is Mr.

574
00:30:20,537 --> 00:30:21,137
Speedo?

575
00:30:22,157 --> 00:30:23,777
Katie is Ms.

576
00:30:23,837 --> 00:30:28,774
Apologetic,  when we're stressed,
we go to these characters that

577
00:30:28,774 --> 00:30:30,724
are not always our best selves.

578
00:30:31,357 --> 00:30:35,450
So when our not so best selves
come out, we can say, it's this

579
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:36,860
other self that's doing it.

580
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,400
We don't have to identify,
be a little more forgiving.

581
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,760
We don't have to identify our
wholesales and the staff have

582
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,470
found that really helpful.

583
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:49,120
Your stuff finds it helpful because
they can check in on and I'll say

584
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:53,720
that to Tiffany in it potentially
stressing situation, I'll say how's Ms.

585
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,010
Overconfident.

586
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,470
Is she bothering you or is
she, you know, taking over?

587
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,570
Oh no, Judy, I think she's under control.

588
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,790
And what is Rosano's cover?

589
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,200
And how many do I have?

590
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:14,370
Oh, maybe one in every country
you go to that's lovely, shy guy.

591
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:15,360
Mr.

592
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,140
Shy guy.

593
00:31:16,823 --> 00:31:19,163
I'm I'm less shy than I was.

594
00:31:19,283 --> 00:31:21,263
So he's kind of going way.

595
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:25,539
what's the name for the person
who's thinking of the, think

596
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:26,979
he thinks of you in the head.

597
00:31:28,115 --> 00:31:33,935
well, yeah, you're reborn, but you all,
it's hard for you to gain presence.

598
00:31:33,995 --> 00:31:34,985
Oh, okay.

599
00:31:34,985 --> 00:31:36,155
So Mr.

600
00:31:36,215 --> 00:31:39,289
I'm not here you're kind of like Mr.

601
00:31:39,289 --> 00:31:45,036
I'm not here when stressed, you know,
like you disappear, So that's also why

602
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:50,556
you move from country to country because
like, you know, disappearing and moving

603
00:31:50,736 --> 00:31:55,926
to another place and then reestablishing
yourself and then kind of disappear

604
00:31:55,926 --> 00:31:57,936
and you're, but you are very spiritual.

605
00:31:57,936 --> 00:32:00,726
You do flow on this magic carpet.

606
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:02,886
I think you're an amazing person.

607
00:32:02,886 --> 00:32:06,169
I really do, but you're still reacting.

608
00:32:07,196 --> 00:32:11,216
You're still not completely yourself,
but you're getting there for your age.

609
00:32:11,216 --> 00:32:12,176
You're doing really well.

610
00:32:12,646 --> 00:32:14,006
Thank you, that's very generous.

611
00:32:14,036 --> 00:32:14,896
Yeah, yeah.

612
00:32:15,343 --> 00:32:15,823
Mr.

613
00:32:15,823 --> 00:32:18,763
Disappearing is always
happy when he is grounded.

614
00:32:18,763 --> 00:32:19,903
So he needs grounding.

615
00:32:20,683 --> 00:32:20,773
Okay.

616
00:32:21,043 --> 00:32:21,643
I love this.

617
00:32:21,643 --> 00:32:24,943
And I'm wondering if it works in
the other direction also where the

618
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,653
thing that you want to be has a name.

619
00:32:27,463 --> 00:32:29,023
So that's a good one.

620
00:32:29,053 --> 00:32:30,673
It would be Mr.

621
00:32:31,188 --> 00:32:31,688
B here.

622
00:32:31,698 --> 00:32:35,928
Now something like the sir or well,
for each of your staff or whoever.

623
00:32:35,978 --> 00:32:38,888
You know what, I think
what you want to be Mr.

624
00:32:38,888 --> 00:32:39,458
Lover?

625
00:32:39,608 --> 00:32:40,298
I could be Mr.

626
00:32:40,298 --> 00:32:40,598
Lover.

627
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:42,668
I could, I could want to be Mr.

628
00:32:42,668 --> 00:32:42,878
Lover.

629
00:32:43,268 --> 00:32:45,818
I think that's what you are
that you want to be, you know,

630
00:32:45,938 --> 00:32:48,438
a lover, in your body lover.

631
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:50,808
I think I want to be Ms.

632
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:54,048
Not nice guy, but be a
nice person all the time.

633
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:54,828
Really?

634
00:32:55,068 --> 00:32:58,368
You want to be that that's shocking to me.

635
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:01,428
Cause I thought you would have been
sick of that or you deliberately try

636
00:33:01,428 --> 00:33:04,248
not to do that because you've targeted,
like trying to please other people

637
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,078
or something, but you want that.

638
00:33:06,978 --> 00:33:07,428
Yeah.

639
00:33:07,428 --> 00:33:09,048
I'd like to be at peace.

640
00:33:09,078 --> 00:33:09,348
Ms.

641
00:33:09,348 --> 00:33:10,308
Peaceful, maybe.

642
00:33:10,393 --> 00:33:13,663
Nice guy, but in a real
way, be kind to people.

643
00:33:13,663 --> 00:33:17,663
I find it sometime really hard
to be kind I have the sharp wit.

644
00:33:17,774 --> 00:33:23,414
I know it has not been easy for you to
be out there in the world on your own,

645
00:33:23,644 --> 00:33:27,394
maybe worried about the next dollar
that you're going to make, or where

646
00:33:27,394 --> 00:33:30,994
are you going to sleep that night or
whatever, putting yourself out there.

647
00:33:31,194 --> 00:33:33,994
But you knew that you had to
do that because if you didn't

648
00:33:33,994 --> 00:33:37,614
do it, the consequences were
worse than the other direction.

649
00:33:37,674 --> 00:33:41,574
And what were the consequences
going to be mental health issues.

650
00:33:41,897 --> 00:33:46,277
You had to fight for your life in a
different way because the society tries

651
00:33:46,277 --> 00:33:48,827
to take it away from you in every term.

652
00:33:48,982 --> 00:33:51,712
Somehow you were given that strength.

653
00:33:51,862 --> 00:33:58,342
Like I was to be able to do that and
say, no, I'm not going to have this free

654
00:33:58,342 --> 00:34:03,582
conscribed life or work for the man worked
for the company and, you know, work on my

655
00:34:03,582 --> 00:34:05,952
computer from home and never go anywhere.

656
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:06,545
Yeah.

657
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:10,445
I was encouraged by a good friend of mine.

658
00:34:10,445 --> 00:34:10,895
He was doing.

659
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:15,440
Pushing me to like buy one of those
backpacks that I can just keep everything

660
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,200
in there and I don't have to hold
anything in my hand and I can walk around.

661
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:22,730
It took him  few years maybe of trying
to prod me to try traveling out.

662
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,720
It was very recently, but
it happened because of

663
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,010
encouragement of people that came.

664
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:30,670
And also people like yourself,
encourage me to do my own thing, be

665
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,490
myself, so to speak , these cliches.

666
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:38,760
But it's meant a lot of , very
profound experiences for me.

667
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:44,310
And I've learned a lot about myself
and I've had a kind of life that

668
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,990
not a lot of people get to have.

669
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,760
And so I'm super grateful about that.

670
00:34:47,997 --> 00:34:51,297
but yeah, I, I don't feel, I can
totally take credit for that.

671
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:54,547
I did put in the work and I did do it,
but , I also just want to acknowledge

672
00:34:54,577 --> 00:34:55,927
like the people that, oh yeah.

673
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:59,257
I mean, it's the same with me too,
because all the thousands of wonderful

674
00:34:59,257 --> 00:35:04,567
people I've met and worked with, but
ultimately you're the center of it.

675
00:35:04,747 --> 00:35:06,367
And you're the center of your world.

676
00:35:06,997 --> 00:35:08,197
You're the one who pushes the button.

677
00:35:09,697 --> 00:35:12,247
That's why I'm saying, that's
why I say, nobody cares.

678
00:35:12,517 --> 00:35:13,387
You got to do it.

679
00:35:14,377 --> 00:35:15,606
That's what I mean by that.

680
00:35:15,987 --> 00:35:20,627
And then ultimately it's your
decision whether you do or you don't

681
00:35:21,274 --> 00:35:24,394
. 
Our society is a very
sick oriented society.

682
00:35:24,649 --> 00:35:30,179
We use sickness as a cop-out that's
always the reason not to do, oh,

683
00:35:30,179 --> 00:35:34,462
I'm this I'm that .  When we get
sick as a reason not to do not

684
00:35:34,462 --> 00:35:37,852
to love, be disappointed in love.

685
00:35:37,852 --> 00:35:38,782
So you get sick.

686
00:35:39,142 --> 00:35:40,102
Sometimes you die.

687
00:35:40,807 --> 00:35:46,657
Not to fight against what your parents
want . So you get sick, you get depressed.

688
00:35:48,007 --> 00:35:49,177
Your will is broken.

689
00:35:49,417 --> 00:35:53,167
The best thing a parent could do for
their child is not to break their will.

690
00:35:53,957 --> 00:35:59,217
We're born with a will, but it can be
broken and society is there to break it.

691
00:36:00,657 --> 00:36:07,794
That's actually, unfortunately the, dark
side of society is to break our Wells so

692
00:36:07,794 --> 00:36:09,954
that we do what society wants us to do.

693
00:36:10,304 --> 00:36:13,454
Why do you think people get
taken in by these scammers?

694
00:36:13,634 --> 00:36:13,994
Wow.

695
00:36:13,994 --> 00:36:15,824
This was the CRA a calling.

696
00:36:16,314 --> 00:36:21,384
They told me that I had a package
of illegal things and that

697
00:36:21,384 --> 00:36:22,554
it was going to be arrested.

698
00:36:23,094 --> 00:36:23,394
Right.

699
00:36:24,774 --> 00:36:26,004
Do you know what I say to them?

700
00:36:26,124 --> 00:36:28,224
Because I always go to the number one.

701
00:36:28,284 --> 00:36:28,794
So the answer.

702
00:36:29,634 --> 00:36:30,444
And the citizen.

703
00:36:30,714 --> 00:36:36,504
Does your mother know that
you're a scammer is not the best?

704
00:36:36,534 --> 00:36:37,944
And how did they respond to that?

705
00:36:38,034 --> 00:36:43,714
Usually they hang up at one
time, a woman said, no, well

706
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,174
said, well, you should tell her.

707
00:36:45,624 --> 00:36:46,944
She should know what you're doing.

708
00:36:48,034 --> 00:36:50,164
How you cheating Canadians
out of their money.

709
00:36:50,636 --> 00:36:51,176
And I hung up.

710
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:56,076
I'm trying to imagine what it's like
for them to treat them as human beings.

711
00:36:56,076 --> 00:36:57,096
They are human beings.

712
00:36:57,126 --> 00:36:57,606
They are.

713
00:36:57,606 --> 00:36:58,056
Yes.

714
00:36:58,086 --> 00:37:01,206
But, and it's almost that it's, that
you've actually like for one you've

715
00:37:01,206 --> 00:37:06,576
acknowledged her humanity, which she's
probably not, she's literally, uh, well

716
00:37:06,606 --> 00:37:09,786
presenting themselves as bots or robots
or whatever, but then also to just

717
00:37:09,786 --> 00:37:13,956
like to come into her situation there,
which no nobody's going to do that.

718
00:37:13,956 --> 00:37:16,806
So I'm, I'm trying to put myself in
that person's shoes, just like, what's

719
00:37:16,806 --> 00:37:20,856
it like to receive that from, from
Judy, from, you know, from somebody

720
00:37:20,856 --> 00:37:27,036
in north America, will we need to
confront them on a human level that

721
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,106
these are people that they're calling.

722
00:37:29,126 --> 00:37:36,026
We are not just stick figures on our money
is not there because it was given to us.

723
00:37:36,856 --> 00:37:40,546
Is that easy for you to
just speak to somebody?

724
00:37:42,346 --> 00:37:48,196
Very easy, because I think, and I can
also be really nasty on the phone when,

725
00:37:48,196 --> 00:37:50,516
when these places call at the restaurant.

726
00:37:50,516 --> 00:37:52,388
I'll say, Nope, the owner died.

727
00:37:52,898 --> 00:37:55,988
We're just folding up the
restaurant now kind of story.

728
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,880
But I mostly get to the mother thing,

729
00:38:00,787 --> 00:38:02,497
and how do you know that that's a thing?

730
00:38:02,527 --> 00:38:06,527
Cause I know it's a thing,
especially with third world

731
00:38:06,527 --> 00:38:08,147
people, a mother is everything.

732
00:38:09,617 --> 00:38:13,117
Mother is the judge of the morality.

733
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:16,557
The keeper or the morals of the
family is really the mother more than

734
00:38:16,557 --> 00:38:20,097
the father in terms of their child.

735
00:38:20,677 --> 00:38:24,647
I think the father keeps the
morals of the outside world, but

736
00:38:25,067 --> 00:38:29,896
the mother really keeps the family
morals in bringing up the child.

737
00:38:30,146 --> 00:38:35,366
The kid on a daily basis has to deal
with the mother on the big issues.

738
00:38:35,366 --> 00:38:39,986
Maybe the father, but on the daily
basis, the mother knows what's going on.

739
00:38:40,299 --> 00:38:43,419
What would it sound like if I said,
does your father know what you're doing?

740
00:38:44,169 --> 00:38:45,939
Does your mother know what you're doing?

741
00:38:46,749 --> 00:38:47,589
What's the difference?

742
00:38:47,749 --> 00:38:49,699
Does your mother know you're a scammer?

743
00:38:49,909 --> 00:38:51,859
Does your father know you're a scammer?

744
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:52,849
What sounds worse?

745
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,779
To me anyway, it feels more emotional.

746
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:55,499
Yeah.

747
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:56,759
It's more emotional.

748
00:38:56,759 --> 00:39:00,899
Canadians don't have the same quite
strong relationship with the mother.

749
00:39:00,899 --> 00:39:06,389
And also the power of women in the family
is not as respected in Canadian cultures.

750
00:39:06,389 --> 00:39:10,799
It doesn't, let's say Sri Lankan
culture or Indian culture.

751
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:11,699
Right.

752
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:14,243
The mother the boss, right?

753
00:39:14,273 --> 00:39:15,323
Chinese.

754
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:18,863
See, we have diminished
the matriarchal here.

755
00:39:19,553 --> 00:39:23,589
It's part of our problem, That's why
we have to have women's lib, because

756
00:39:23,629 --> 00:39:26,039
we so weaken women into  nothingness.

757
00:39:26,588 --> 00:39:29,018
put them in the suburbs to
give anything away from them.

758
00:39:29,858 --> 00:39:31,418
And they didn't even have to cook anymore.

759
00:39:31,418 --> 00:39:36,665
Just open up packages and then took
all the power, which is terrible.

760
00:39:38,305 --> 00:39:39,265
Well, when you put it like that.

761
00:39:40,082 --> 00:39:41,432
Are you recording all this one?

762
00:39:41,432 --> 00:39:42,182
My God.

763
00:39:42,392 --> 00:39:42,842
That's great.

764
00:39:45,002 --> 00:39:45,812
Don't tell them.

765
00:39:45,812 --> 00:39:48,362
It's me tell them it's somebody else.

766
00:39:51,242 --> 00:39:56,012
Judy recorded this, play it.

767
00:39:56,012 --> 00:39:58,352
When I croak, just come to my funeral.

768
00:39:58,382 --> 00:39:59,972
Everybody who's listening to this.

769
00:39:59,972 --> 00:40:01,592
You're invited to my funeral.

770
00:40:02,342 --> 00:40:03,362
I'm 71.

771
00:40:03,362 --> 00:40:07,532
I'm gonna live to be 102 to 31 years.

772
00:40:07,862 --> 00:40:08,852
Come to my funeral.

773
00:40:08,852 --> 00:40:14,822
I need 10,000 people and it's going to
be a big party and I'm going to be thrown

774
00:40:14,822 --> 00:40:17,332
into the ocean in a mermaid coffin.

775
00:40:17,572 --> 00:40:19,072
I'm going out like a mermaid.

776
00:40:19,532 --> 00:40:21,032
I'm not going to be buried in the ground.

777
00:40:21,272 --> 00:40:24,482
I went to a funeral last year and
I saw the cold or this little,

778
00:40:24,902 --> 00:40:29,362
you know, this little  piece,
so small and just stuck in it.

779
00:40:30,172 --> 00:40:31,222
Who wants to be there?

780
00:40:31,222 --> 00:40:32,722
I don't want to be in the ocean.

781
00:40:33,202 --> 00:40:34,162
It's taken me away.

782
00:40:34,727 --> 00:40:35,567
Take me away.

783
00:40:36,557 --> 00:40:38,267
Did you get that idea from somewhere?

784
00:40:38,267 --> 00:40:40,517
Is that your creative thing?

785
00:40:41,197 --> 00:40:42,537
I was a scuba diver.

786
00:40:42,866 --> 00:40:47,906
So I have experienced the underwater
and, and also some of the most  extent

787
00:40:47,906 --> 00:40:50,156
at times of my life underwater.

788
00:40:50,246 --> 00:40:55,796
And because I've been swimming every
week for like 45 years, I have a strong

789
00:40:55,796 --> 00:41:00,876
relationship with the water and I saw a
movie on women who want to be mermaids,

790
00:41:01,266 --> 00:41:05,856
who mermaid costumes and go down to
the beach and lie on the sand and their

791
00:41:05,856 --> 00:41:10,566
mermaid costumes, which I'm hoping to
be able to do at some point in my life.

792
00:41:11,646 --> 00:41:13,296
So why not?

793
00:41:13,356 --> 00:41:13,686
Right.

794
00:41:14,259 --> 00:41:18,399
I think my generation is going to
have very creative funerals and

795
00:41:18,399 --> 00:41:23,569
I'd say that a good business to get
into would be guitar-shaped coffins.

796
00:41:24,909 --> 00:41:28,359
I heard a chair first get in on
the ground floor guitar shaped

797
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:31,029
coffins, or shaped coffins, right?

798
00:41:31,629 --> 00:41:35,679
I'd say half the men in my generation are
going to want to be buried in a guitar

799
00:41:36,489 --> 00:41:38,319
because of the electric guitar fender.

800
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:40,899
They all see themselves as artists.

801
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:44,539
I've been exploring the feminine,
the masculine what's the feminine

802
00:41:44,539 --> 00:41:48,428
about feminine's very beautiful,
very deep, so it's masculine.

803
00:41:48,478 --> 00:41:51,568
but you know, we all have
both sides to ourselves.

804
00:41:51,758 --> 00:41:59,045
We need not be afraid of those sides,
but I also know that we do gain our

805
00:41:59,045 --> 00:42:02,875
main orientation from the opposite sex.

806
00:42:03,235 --> 00:42:08,685
women, gain their deep femininity
from men and men gain their

807
00:42:08,685 --> 00:42:10,635
deep masculinity from women.

808
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,350
from a relationship with a woman,
you will get the feeling of being

809
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:18,210
a man, not from another man.

810
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:22,090
The deep feeling of being a
man, you will get a surface.

811
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:25,150
Let's say the father gets
you to join a team sport.

812
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:25,810
Okay.

813
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,130
I'm one of the boys.

814
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,520
And then the team, that's
like a surface man, but the

815
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,830
deep man comes from the woman.

816
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:43,617
What's a deep Deep man is the
man who pleases a woman who truly

817
00:42:43,617 --> 00:42:45,507
pleases a woman is a deep man.

818
00:42:46,977 --> 00:42:52,127
And the deep woman is the
one who can be pleased.

819
00:42:52,607 --> 00:42:58,217
The one who can be pleased can be
pleased Who let's the man please her.

820
00:42:59,130 --> 00:42:59,340
Ms.

821
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:05,022
Surrenders gives herself the
permission to enjoy it's right.

822
00:43:05,052 --> 00:43:07,362
I think that's what
all sexuality is about.

823
00:43:07,362 --> 00:43:12,442
Is it though surrendering
and dominating surrendering?

824
00:43:12,884 --> 00:43:17,384
Unfortunately in our society
is so repressed that it comes

825
00:43:17,384 --> 00:43:18,974
out in a lot of pornography.

826
00:43:19,645 --> 00:43:22,069
which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

827
00:43:22,069 --> 00:43:25,489
It's only a bad thing
because it becomes obsessive.

828
00:43:25,752 --> 00:43:30,192
That's actually a big illness in
our society because people's natural

829
00:43:30,192 --> 00:43:35,087
sexuality has been denied that it's
not interwoven into our ceremonies and

830
00:43:35,087 --> 00:43:37,817
mentor, social being, it's kind of hidden.

831
00:43:38,727 --> 00:43:40,507
It's always like the dark side.

832
00:43:40,887 --> 00:43:41,537
Clandestine?

833
00:43:41,917 --> 00:43:42,117
Yeah.

834
00:43:42,477 --> 00:43:43,337
Have you watched Goop?

835
00:43:44,087 --> 00:43:44,307
Goop?

836
00:43:45,037 --> 00:43:48,522
The Gwyneth Paltrow documentary
dynamometry or it's like a

837
00:43:48,522 --> 00:43:50,562
Netflix series about sex.

838
00:43:50,784 --> 00:43:53,694
A bunch of different couples come
together and Gwyneth Paltrow is going to

839
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:57,264
put them together with a therapist and
they're going to try and improve each

840
00:43:57,264 --> 00:43:59,694
couple's sex life in a different way.

841
00:43:59,694 --> 00:44:02,034
Cause it's a couple of different
issues that they're struggling with.

842
00:44:02,148 --> 00:44:04,338
It's a lot of relationship with body.

843
00:44:04,348 --> 00:44:08,398
Healthier relationships towards
the body towards sexuality.

844
00:44:08,908 --> 00:44:13,028
They even had an elderly couple there,
sort of a taboo thing or something elderly

845
00:44:13,028 --> 00:44:15,638
in their mind, they use the word elderly.

846
00:44:15,998 --> 00:44:26,275
Um, but those people were maybe in their
sixties or seventies, so they used the

847
00:44:26,275 --> 00:44:32,125
word elderly, Rosa, I consider you mature.

848
00:44:32,155 --> 00:44:37,915
I consider you an elder elder,
but not elderly elder though.

849
00:44:37,945 --> 00:44:39,895
No, I consider you young actually.

850
00:44:40,185 --> 00:44:42,235
You're, you're quite useful, you know?

851
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:47,422
you ride a bike and you got a hula hoop
thing going sometimes, and you're a hippie

852
00:44:47,422 --> 00:44:51,142
and then you leave your door unlocked
and you put your, but I still don't lock.

853
00:44:51,192 --> 00:44:51,982
You don't lock your door.

854
00:44:51,982 --> 00:44:55,582
You have just, don't tell them where
I, I won't tell anybody I do it.

855
00:44:55,612 --> 00:45:01,102
I only do it when, like, I go away, you
know, like going out to town or something,

856
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:02,482
but that doesn't happen too often.

857
00:45:02,647 --> 00:45:06,517
Or if there's workmen around, you know,
like if there's people around and it

858
00:45:06,517 --> 00:45:09,427
was a low strangest around, I will walk.

859
00:45:09,517 --> 00:45:09,667
Yeah.

860
00:45:10,057 --> 00:45:11,617
There's people   who don't
live here essentially.

861
00:45:11,617 --> 00:45:11,677
Yeah.

862
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,460
I just don't want to lock my door.

863
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,620
I don't want to get
locked out of my own home.

864
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,570
Isn't that crazy?

865
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,700
It seems like there's this parallel
between the coffin, like not

866
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,790
being, wanting to be in a box and
locked in a box around freedom.

867
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:24,240
My total.

868
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:25,050
Yeah.

869
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:32,940
I'm always doing practices of
liberation, liberation, and also true.

870
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:37,260
We need to practice these things.

871
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,070
We need to put ourselves in a
situation where we might lose and

872
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:44,500
see what happens you certainly have.

873
00:45:45,103 --> 00:45:46,383
And how has that matured you?

874
00:45:47,193 --> 00:45:49,343
Oh, uh, it's been fantastic.

875
00:45:49,883 --> 00:45:50,963
I wouldn't trade it for anything.

876
00:45:52,244 --> 00:45:59,128
if you'd stayed in the normal society, you
wouldn't have gained all this insight and

877
00:45:59,128 --> 00:46:01,588
confidence that you've gotten from Lucy.

878
00:46:01,648 --> 00:46:02,098
Right.

879
00:46:02,128 --> 00:46:03,778
You've had things stolen from you.

880
00:46:03,918 --> 00:46:04,158
Actually.

881
00:46:04,158 --> 00:46:05,998
I haven't, I haven't been
pretty lucky in that.

882
00:46:05,998 --> 00:46:13,798
I haven't really had much to say except
from the police, but, um, but other

883
00:46:13,798 --> 00:46:17,294
than that, no, I mean, I've, I've
surprised myself because I'm sort of new

884
00:46:17,294 --> 00:46:22,344
to traveling and this idea of staying
in  strangers' homes and, uh, whether

885
00:46:22,344 --> 00:46:25,164
it's Airbnb or couch surfing or friend
of a friend or whatever, but like,

886
00:46:25,194 --> 00:46:29,244
I've always just trusted the person
and I've never like, lost anything.

887
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,074
So I've been really fortunate
in that respect for it.

888
00:46:31,674 --> 00:46:33,844
And I've stayed in like a
lot of other people's places.

889
00:46:34,332 --> 00:46:37,532
it's like almost something should've
happened by now, but, um, no, I mean, I

890
00:46:37,532 --> 00:46:42,332
I've been very fortunate, but also there's
so much to be gained from just accepting

891
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:44,122
that good things happen from randomness.

892
00:46:44,122 --> 00:46:45,832
Like you can't always control everything.

893
00:46:45,832 --> 00:46:49,182
I think, you know, we say we don't
want to take the risk, but what is

894
00:46:49,182 --> 00:46:56,132
the risk on the other side in terms of
your social self and your soul self.

895
00:46:57,242 --> 00:47:02,612
I want to ask you another thing
about tech cause again, I find it

896
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:07,262
so curious that someone from your
era is in this present today, which

897
00:47:07,262 --> 00:47:10,622
is so hyper-connected and mobile.

898
00:47:10,812 --> 00:47:15,692
Is there something you wish people
would carry over from like the older

899
00:47:15,782 --> 00:47:18,692
kinds of media that you grew up with?

900
00:47:18,742 --> 00:47:20,752
I don't know, TV, radio,
newspaper, whatever.

901
00:47:20,802 --> 00:47:25,362
Because now we have all these new patterns
and it's very fast and very instantaneous.

902
00:47:25,412 --> 00:47:31,222
Is there something  from  older technology
that you would like to see represented?

903
00:47:32,414 --> 00:47:37,464
Oh, well, I think of new technology
more than old, my fantasy is that

904
00:47:37,464 --> 00:47:42,054
we'll have chips implanted in
our fingers for various things.

905
00:47:42,054 --> 00:47:47,624
And one of them is going to be our
computer implant and that we touched

906
00:47:47,624 --> 00:47:50,454
the table and that becomes so computer.

907
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:54,454
So you're looking more into the
future and you want to see this?

908
00:47:54,814 --> 00:47:57,424
I told all the old stuff
is already in there.

909
00:47:57,724 --> 00:47:58,144
Isn't it?

910
00:47:58,264 --> 00:48:00,544
I mean, you have, this is a podcast radio.

911
00:48:00,724 --> 00:48:04,264
Well, I'm not actually asking, I'm
not asking about the technology.

912
00:48:05,254 --> 00:48:11,104
I mean like the way you would interact
with people, maybe there are certain

913
00:48:11,104 --> 00:48:15,694
ways of interacting with people that are
maybe no longer present and maybe that

914
00:48:15,694 --> 00:48:19,954
could have been good or maybe not, you
know, and maybe the way we do things

915
00:48:19,954 --> 00:48:27,654
now, sort of asynchronously and short
messages and or not handwritten or not.

916
00:48:27,724 --> 00:48:28,714
Do you miss anything?

917
00:48:29,914 --> 00:48:34,744
I think the ways of communicating
now are so varied and exciting.

918
00:48:34,804 --> 00:48:36,184
I think it's fantastic.

919
00:48:36,544 --> 00:48:39,844
Like all communicate with
different people in different ways.

920
00:48:39,904 --> 00:48:46,434
It's excitement, instant messaging,
WhatsApp, texting, telephone.

921
00:48:46,434 --> 00:48:46,944
Audio message.

922
00:48:46,944 --> 00:48:51,668
FaceTime, face time,
audio message pictures.

923
00:48:52,238 --> 00:48:53,348
So it's exciting for you.

924
00:48:53,348 --> 00:48:54,128
It's stimulating.

925
00:48:54,158 --> 00:48:55,028
Very exciting.

926
00:48:55,078 --> 00:49:00,148
But I think the hardware it's tricky
because you don't want to lose your phone.

927
00:49:00,178 --> 00:49:00,478
Right.

928
00:49:00,868 --> 00:49:03,838
I think we, we, we need to
have chips embedded in us.

929
00:49:04,288 --> 00:49:06,298
I don't want to have keys anymore.

930
00:49:06,838 --> 00:49:09,568
I don't want to have hardware anymore.

931
00:49:09,568 --> 00:49:13,318
We should have it in us and we've touched
surfaces and that becomes our hardware.

932
00:49:13,638 --> 00:49:13,888
Wow.

933
00:49:15,924 --> 00:49:16,974
I'm not even there yet.

934
00:49:17,574 --> 00:49:19,194
I need, that's just my fantasy.

935
00:49:19,194 --> 00:49:20,934
How that could actually happen.

936
00:49:21,474 --> 00:49:23,364
Oh, I don't doubt that
that's going to happen.

937
00:49:23,364 --> 00:49:25,134
I mean, I think that's totally reasonable.

938
00:49:25,368 --> 00:49:27,228
Where can people find out
more about what you're doing?

939
00:49:31,278 --> 00:49:34,278
What's your free times come to the
free times, restaurant three 20

940
00:49:34,278 --> 00:49:37,518
colors street, Toronto, two free times

941
00:49:37,968 --> 00:49:39,018
Anything else you want to mention?

942
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:44,670
okay, so this is my advice to all of
you, the three prong approach to problem

943
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:52,440
solving delay, as long as possible, get
more information, get more information,

944
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:54,810
look where you are for the answer.

945
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,390
It's usually right in front of you.

946
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,260
Amazing.

947
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:02,960
Thanks so much for being with me Judy.

948
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,580
Namaste.

949
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,870
Namaste.

950
00:50:09,384 --> 00:50:12,771
That was my extended conversation
with Judy Perly on the

951
00:50:12,771 --> 00:50:14,121
