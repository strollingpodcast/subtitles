00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:07,409
Welcome to Strolling,
conversations with people.

2
00:00:07,409 --> 00:00:08,309
I meet along the way.

3
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:13,469
I'm Rosano here with Judy Perly, owner
of Toronto's Free times cafe, which

4
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:17,309
has been serving authentic Jewish and
middle Eastern food for over 40 years

5
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:21,749
while also functioning as a hub for
folk music in the city, with live shows

6
00:00:21,749 --> 00:00:25,229
during the week and a songwriter open
stage that's been running for decades.

7
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:28,235
What struck me from our exchange
was her spirit of usefulness,

8
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:30,575
curiosity and freedom at 71 years.

9
00:00:30,785 --> 00:00:33,395
the connections between
everything become apparent with

10
00:00:33,395 --> 00:00:34,860
her holistic view of the world.

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,940
Making it effortless to jump from
food, to art, to politics, to life.

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,110
Despite recording at the tail end of an
exhausting day, her presence with me was

13
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,940
lively, generous, and sharp as a knife.

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,400
It's a privilege to have
Judy as my first guest.

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,710
So without further ado, let's get into it.

16
00:00:50,152 --> 00:00:53,302
judy, welcome to the podcast
and thanks for being here.

17
00:00:53,482 --> 00:00:55,132
Oh, thank you.

18
00:00:55,442 --> 00:00:56,702
What do most people know you for?

19
00:00:57,148 --> 00:01:00,758
They know me as the owner of free
times cafe on college street,

20
00:01:00,868 --> 00:01:02,578
no me for other things too.

21
00:01:02,578 --> 00:01:08,588
Like, you know, my yoga friends know me as
a yogini and people know me from part of

22
00:01:08,588 --> 00:01:12,308
a group of people that swim, swim lengths.

23
00:01:12,358 --> 00:01:16,588
People who live in my condo, normally
it's this woman who owns a restaurant.

24
00:01:16,688 --> 00:01:22,508
My identity and the present is from my
well-known business free times cafe.

25
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:28,764
And I'm known as the local yid
in downtown Toronto, the one

26
00:01:28,884 --> 00:01:30,774
that represents Jewish culture.

27
00:01:30,804 --> 00:01:32,508
Right, And it's been like that for awhile.

28
00:01:32,508 --> 00:01:32,988
I imagined.

29
00:01:33,378 --> 00:01:33,738
Yeah.

30
00:01:33,768 --> 00:01:38,358
For like 25 years the Jewish
part and on the free times for

31
00:01:38,358 --> 00:01:41,298
like over 40 years, 40 years.

32
00:01:41,418 --> 00:01:41,898
Yeah.

33
00:01:43,008 --> 00:01:45,798
And where are you at right now?

34
00:01:46,518 --> 00:01:47,058
What do you mean?

35
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:47,748
Where am I at?

36
00:01:47,848 --> 00:01:49,228
After 40 years, what do you do?

37
00:01:49,278 --> 00:01:50,938
Do you just shut it down?

38
00:01:50,998 --> 00:01:54,328
Like I emote, every day
I rant about something.

39
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:58,471
I conceptualize I try to see
the world in a bigger picture.

40
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:02,281
I don't agree with most of
the status quo of things.

41
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:06,141
I worry about the state of the
world and very concerned in the bill

42
00:02:06,141 --> 00:02:07,821
of goods is been sold to people.

43
00:02:08,198 --> 00:02:09,368
What's the bill of goods?

44
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:16,238
The bill of goods is this
fearful negative view of life.

45
00:02:16,268 --> 00:02:18,638
This limiting negative view of life.

46
00:02:18,887 --> 00:02:21,347
And COVID is just a symptom of that.

47
00:02:21,617 --> 00:02:24,802
And that was just part of his
ongoing negative view, which

48
00:02:24,802 --> 00:02:26,632
started when I was young.

49
00:02:26,632 --> 00:02:28,072
And I was a teacher in that.

50
00:02:28,072 --> 00:02:33,762
And I left teaching when I was 26 because
I found the system so hypocritical

51
00:02:35,682 --> 00:02:37,542
weren't really interested in teaching.

52
00:02:37,592 --> 00:02:41,702
The main topic of conversation in
the staff room was the pension,

53
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:44,595
the mortgage, and the racist jokes.

54
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:46,569
And I always wanted more.

55
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:52,316
I wanted to be more in this world having
one more authentic life and to be free.

56
00:02:52,316 --> 00:02:54,716
I always strove to feel free.

57
00:02:55,703 --> 00:02:59,999
And, you know, I was an artist and I
wanted to reinvent myself every time.

58
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:04,817
And I got into cooking and then I
just cooked my way through life.

59
00:03:05,264 --> 00:03:07,394
I was given the gift of cooking.

60
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:10,499
You've had my food and whatever I cook.

61
00:03:10,499 --> 00:03:11,129
It's good.

62
00:03:12,089 --> 00:03:13,619
And I never know what it's going to be.

63
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:17,559
The food speaks to me and
tells me what to do with it.

64
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:21,459
So it sounds like food is not
just a nutritional thing for you.

65
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:23,789
Like what, what does it
mean ? Is it like a social thing?

66
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:25,199
Is it like a magical thing?

67
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,999
Is it like a artistic thing?

68
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:27,149
Like

69
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:31,129
It's a soul thing for me,  cooking
makes my soul feel good.

70
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:36,409
You know, when I cook, I feel good if I
don't feel good and I cook, I feel good.

71
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:38,029
So it's my cure.

72
00:03:38,614 --> 00:03:40,144
It's the cure for my soul.

73
00:03:41,044 --> 00:03:43,914
I  feel people are cooking
at home less and less today.

74
00:03:44,334 --> 00:03:44,904
Do you think that's okay.

75
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:45,714
Well, it was cold.

76
00:03:45,744 --> 00:03:48,624
People started cooking more, but
they're getting all this prepared

77
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:51,504
stuff in boxes and it tells you
what to do and this and that.

78
00:03:51,504 --> 00:03:54,654
And I don't necessarily agree with it.

79
00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:58,314
I'm not saying it's entirely
wrong, but cooking is much

80
00:03:58,314 --> 00:03:59,964
easier than people think it is.

81
00:04:00,294 --> 00:04:06,414
Oh, you just need to have a few of
the right utensils, but not too many.

82
00:04:06,984 --> 00:04:10,974
people complicate cooking and
they complicate it with recipes.

83
00:04:11,244 --> 00:04:13,384
I'm somewhat against recipes.

84
00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:15,894
Yea, you convinced me
to stop using recipes.

85
00:04:15,894 --> 00:04:20,214
And that totally changed my relationship
with, I think I became a chef in some

86
00:04:20,214 --> 00:04:25,164
sense, like, because, or I just tell
you that to stop using investigates,

87
00:04:25,194 --> 00:04:29,538
you told me go to the supermarket,
buy whatever you like, take a carrot

88
00:04:29,538 --> 00:04:30,588
and just bite it, just eat it.

89
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:32,238
Like it just tasted directly.

90
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:35,118
And then you start to get a sense
of the flavors and the tastes.

91
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:37,128
And that, that really happened for me.

92
00:04:37,128 --> 00:04:38,838
It was like, oh, okay.

93
00:04:39,048 --> 00:04:40,218
And I totally didn't think that was.

94
00:04:40,878 --> 00:04:44,688
But yeah, it like over time, it's like,
oh, actually I kind of liked that.

95
00:04:44,688 --> 00:04:47,748
I like when it's cut like this,
I like this when it's with that.

96
00:04:48,168 --> 00:04:48,558
Right.

97
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:50,808
And you don't have to cut
it the same way every time.

98
00:04:50,808 --> 00:04:54,258
And every time when I cook, I don't
necessarily make the things the same.

99
00:04:54,408 --> 00:04:57,438
Like when I make meat sauce, every
time I make it, it's different.

100
00:04:57,468 --> 00:04:58,998
It's not exactly the same.

101
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,168
Why should it be?

102
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:05,268
Yeah, you see, this is the thing of north
America, where we mass produce things.

103
00:05:05,298 --> 00:05:05,958
The same.

104
00:05:06,228 --> 00:05:10,458
We have this, this idea that
everything has to be the same.

105
00:05:10,828 --> 00:05:14,568
Or it has to be the there's the
expert, the idea of the expert

106
00:05:14,568 --> 00:05:16,068
and the expert has the recipe.

107
00:05:16,368 --> 00:05:19,878
And if you follow the recipe
of the expert, you will have

108
00:05:19,878 --> 00:05:22,278
achieved expertise yourself.

109
00:05:22,368 --> 00:05:23,118
Not true.

110
00:05:24,828 --> 00:05:25,818
It's kind of a new idea.

111
00:05:25,818 --> 00:05:29,658
I guess, though, you can buy experience
or expertise or something like that.

112
00:05:30,568 --> 00:05:33,268
maybe a hundred or two years, a
hundred years ago, like you would

113
00:05:33,268 --> 00:05:38,428
have had to have the experience in
order to achieve a certain thing.

114
00:05:39,118 --> 00:05:42,778
Look, women were cooking for thousands
of years and getting no credit for it.

115
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:47,218
Every family had a personal chef
and we didn't call it that we

116
00:05:47,218 --> 00:05:49,888
just called it your mother, right.

117
00:05:50,188 --> 00:05:51,748
Some were better than others.

118
00:05:52,168 --> 00:05:54,808
Pretty well every family
had a personal chef.

119
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,228
Think about it in today's world.

120
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:03,208
It's a rarity that, that, you know,
you're going to get all your meals

121
00:06:03,318 --> 00:06:06,283
cooked by somebody there in the house.

122
00:06:06,313 --> 00:06:06,643
Right.

123
00:06:06,763 --> 00:06:07,903
They might cook some of them.

124
00:06:08,053 --> 00:06:12,937
You, yeah, but some very beautiful
things are done through food.

125
00:06:12,937 --> 00:06:16,147
Food was my, my go-to and it still is.

126
00:06:16,197 --> 00:06:19,077
There was a time in my life
where I was so unhappy.

127
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:21,627
The only time I was happy
was when I was cooking.

128
00:06:22,576 --> 00:06:25,996
So, you know, cooking as a
therapy is, is, is strong.

129
00:06:26,296 --> 00:06:27,886
I think it's a wonderful thing to do.

130
00:06:28,006 --> 00:06:32,686
I mean, we need to take people with mental
health issues and get them into cooking

131
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:38,356
and not just in these institutionalized
kitchens, these big kitchens.

132
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:38,806
No.

133
00:06:38,836 --> 00:06:41,806
Mental health has to be something
in people's homes, you know,

134
00:06:41,806 --> 00:06:43,126
it has to be matched up.

135
00:06:44,236 --> 00:06:49,826
I feel like people don't think about food
is a cure for mental health specifically.

136
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,536
Like how do you see that connection?

137
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:56,086
Well, the process of
it is very therapeutic.

138
00:06:56,086 --> 00:06:59,116
You know, we're involved
with creating something.

139
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,476
Creation is always satisfying.

140
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:09,706
And you need to eat your
nourishing yourself, keeping

141
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:11,626
your energy up good health.

142
00:07:11,626 --> 00:07:12,766
And it's very social.

143
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:15,826
Somebody who knows how to
cook is going to have friends.

144
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,386
People are going to
want to be around them.

145
00:07:17,686 --> 00:07:19,036
They're going to want
to go to their house.

146
00:07:19,216 --> 00:07:22,306
Maybe if they're not very verbal
or they don't have greatest person.

147
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:25,981
They can at least cook a meal
and people want to be there.

148
00:07:26,761 --> 00:07:28,081
It's something to offer.

149
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:29,491
And it's a giving thing.

150
00:07:29,521 --> 00:07:31,741
You're giving it to other people.

151
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,308
You can learn generosity.

152
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:36,148
But we need to eat to live.

153
00:07:36,298 --> 00:07:37,498
And it's so basic.

154
00:07:37,888 --> 00:07:38,848
We get hungry.

155
00:07:38,878 --> 00:07:39,868
We need to eat.

156
00:07:40,468 --> 00:07:44,848
And if you involve yourself with all
the little bits of food that you have in

157
00:07:44,848 --> 00:07:49,858
your fridge and you create a delicious
meal out of it, this is a work of art.

158
00:07:50,188 --> 00:07:51,418
And it's very satisfying.

159
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:57,328
We forget that a lot of mental health
issues have nothing to do with our brains.

160
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:01,798
They have to do with our souls and we
have forgotten what a soul is in this

161
00:08:01,798 --> 00:08:05,968
world, you know, and the soul is not
your body and it's not your brain.

162
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:12,468
It's the flow of your life in your
brain and your body, it's like

163
00:08:12,468 --> 00:08:14,658
who you are and where you take it.

164
00:08:14,868 --> 00:08:16,188
And it's everything combined.

165
00:08:16,188 --> 00:08:18,468
Everything put together is your soul.

166
00:08:19,114 --> 00:08:22,224
But we've compartmentalized and
we've really killed the soul.

167
00:08:22,314 --> 00:08:24,774
And this is why we have so
many mental health issues.

168
00:08:24,984 --> 00:08:26,694
Because we've lost connection with soul.

169
00:08:26,754 --> 00:08:27,054
Yeah.

170
00:08:27,606 --> 00:08:28,416
Thomas Moore.

171
00:08:28,806 --> 00:08:28,986
Okay.

172
00:08:28,996 --> 00:08:31,506
Not the English writer, but
this is American philosopher.

173
00:08:31,506 --> 00:08:34,326
He said the soul likes small things.

174
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:37,566
And that sentence changed my life.

175
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:42,531
So whenever you are unhappy, for
whatever reason, you don't know

176
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:44,181
why I don't feel good today.

177
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:45,651
I'm unhappy, I'm anxious.

178
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:46,731
I'm angry on this.

179
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:47,241
I'm that.

180
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:53,211
And you know, you engage in some
small activity like sweeping the floor

181
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:55,041
or wiping off a table or something.

182
00:08:55,041 --> 00:09:00,411
Just the involvement in that
small activity can sooth the soul.

183
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:06,121
Women traditionally have been
involved in these mundane acts.

184
00:09:06,601 --> 00:09:11,311
So people talk of their
mothers in a different way than

185
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:12,571
they do with their fathers.

186
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:17,101
And they often see their mothers as
having more soul in their fathers.

187
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:21,211
And I think it's mainly because
the women were relegated to doing

188
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:27,121
these small tasks and actually in
a way that was their liberation.

189
00:09:28,846 --> 00:09:32,296
You mentioned wanting to be free earlier.

190
00:09:33,436 --> 00:09:34,246
How do you feel today?

191
00:09:34,246 --> 00:09:34,876
Do you feel free?

192
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:37,426
Yeah, I do pretty free.

193
00:09:37,456 --> 00:09:41,266
Not completely free, but I
feel freer than I've ever felt.

194
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:41,686
I'd say.

195
00:09:42,804 --> 00:09:46,404
I mean, you have a lot of
things to do every week.

196
00:09:46,404 --> 00:09:47,874
You have a restaurant you're managing it.

197
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:51,864
Some people would say that's being tied
down or you have commitments or whatever,

198
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:54,954
but you feel free in spite of all of this.

199
00:09:55,614 --> 00:09:55,974
Yeah.

200
00:09:56,004 --> 00:09:59,484
But having those commitments and
having to get up and go somewhere,

201
00:09:59,694 --> 00:10:01,134
it's just kind of ordinary.

202
00:10:02,094 --> 00:10:06,234
But feeling really free is
something that you earn over time.

203
00:10:06,654 --> 00:10:11,584
You know, that's like clearing out, hiring
the organizer and decluttering, you know,

204
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:13,654
that's years and years of decluttering.

205
00:10:14,444 --> 00:10:17,384
Well, this is what I mean, because it
seems like you're not talking about some

206
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:21,494
purely logistical thing of like, having
time, for example, because you don't

207
00:10:21,494 --> 00:10:24,717
really, I mean, you're busy, and I think
that's what people associate with freedom.

208
00:10:24,717 --> 00:10:26,097
It's like, oh, I have the time.

209
00:10:26,097 --> 00:10:28,767
Or maybe I'm like filthy
rich or something like that.

210
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:31,467
But it means something other
than that, I do have time.

211
00:10:31,467 --> 00:10:32,247
I take time.

212
00:10:32,247 --> 00:10:34,167
Like I take three hours in the morning.

213
00:10:35,007 --> 00:10:37,857
Sometimes I lie in bed for an
hour before I get out of bed.

214
00:10:38,487 --> 00:10:43,377
I take the time to have the time,
have a nice bed in my, in my bed.

215
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:46,409
I don't clutter my life
is a lot of busy work.

216
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:54,839
actually in Cove, I felt more free in
many ways because I had my nights free and

217
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:56,729
didn't have to relate to so many people.

218
00:10:56,979 --> 00:11:00,249
It was so nice to come home and cook
dinner for myself every night and have

219
00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:09,112
all this delicious and then to give it
to others That's one, one part of it,

220
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:15,292
you know, doing yoga, hired my yoga
teacher, two classes of yoga for like the

221
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:17,332
last year and a bed that's been amazing.

222
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:21,955
But feeling free is a state of being,
you know, it's not a situation.

223
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:29,128
The only thing that would drive me crazy
would be,  I could be locked up in a

224
00:11:29,128 --> 00:11:36,872
room, but noise would drive me crazy, like
constant, loud rock music or a constant

225
00:11:36,872 --> 00:11:39,692
loud noise that would drive me crazy.

226
00:11:40,802 --> 00:11:44,222
Or if I have to eat really awful
food, all that would be hard.

227
00:11:44,402 --> 00:11:50,072
But if it was very plain food, I would
be okay with it, like real food that was

228
00:11:50,072 --> 00:11:56,253
playing, like, let's say plain boiled
potatoes, what's awful, you know, packaged

229
00:11:56,253 --> 00:12:01,803
food phones, you know, commercial,
food, commercial food, the chemicals.

230
00:12:01,893 --> 00:12:03,003
It's not really food.

231
00:12:03,445 --> 00:12:04,645
What are you close minded about?

232
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:11,445
Ooh, close minded about,  I think I'm
close minded about people who aren't,

233
00:12:11,445 --> 00:12:14,265
risk-takers, too careful in their lives.

234
00:12:14,585 --> 00:12:15,225
I've talked with that.

235
00:12:16,813 --> 00:12:21,073
Close minded about people who
are in relationships for ulterior

236
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:27,103
motives, like for money or for
status people that use other pupil.

237
00:12:27,103 --> 00:12:31,273
I'm pretty close minded about
materialistic people to the extreme.

238
00:12:31,683 --> 00:12:33,333
Not that I don't like things, I do.

239
00:12:33,643 --> 00:12:37,993
Not that I don't have friends that will
spend lots of money, uncles, but people

240
00:12:37,993 --> 00:12:42,313
who are not generous, I'm pretty close
minded about people who are selfish.

241
00:12:43,454 --> 00:12:47,224
It's interesting that you're always
referencing people as opposed to some

242
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:53,744
kind of ideology or a school of thought
or something, or just a way to, oh yeah.

243
00:12:54,161 --> 00:12:54,701
Cool.

244
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:55,001
Yeah.

245
00:12:55,001 --> 00:13:00,422
I'm pretty closed minded about,
letting people starve, and out and

246
00:13:00,422 --> 00:13:03,002
wars I'm completely against wars.

247
00:13:03,656 --> 00:13:08,386
Letting people starve has something to do
with food waste for you also, other than,

248
00:13:08,476 --> 00:13:09,806
you know,  taking care of one another.

249
00:13:09,806 --> 00:13:16,094
I mean, it seems like a topic that all
absolutely shameful and we're the worst

250
00:13:16,154 --> 00:13:18,674
culprits in the world, north America.

251
00:13:18,704 --> 00:13:19,124
Yeah.

252
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:20,684
But there's no penalty on it.

253
00:13:22,064 --> 00:13:26,577
Well, whatever, you know, there's
no penalty for food waste, We waste

254
00:13:26,577 --> 00:13:32,097
by 40% of all food, but I'm not
talking about dumpster diving either.

255
00:13:32,247 --> 00:13:33,807
I'm not in favor of dumpster diving.

256
00:13:34,017 --> 00:13:38,287
Not that I would say
judge people who do it.

257
00:13:38,307 --> 00:13:43,227
Cause I can understand doing, I
really can, but the fact that we put

258
00:13:43,317 --> 00:13:46,797
all this food in the dumpster, in
the first place, that's the problem.

259
00:13:46,917 --> 00:13:47,157
Right.

260
00:13:47,337 --> 00:13:47,607
Right.

261
00:13:47,607 --> 00:13:53,373
In this whole, before due date, things
is an artificial manufacturer because

262
00:13:53,373 --> 00:13:55,353
that was just a way to move more product.

263
00:13:55,383 --> 00:13:56,913
It's not necessarily that.

264
00:13:57,513 --> 00:13:58,743
Oh yeah, yeah.

265
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:04,773
Actually we just did that so they could
keep the shelves full and somebody could

266
00:14:04,773 --> 00:14:06,483
buy it and it was still last at home.

267
00:14:06,693 --> 00:14:10,503
So they would just take the stuff that was
two or three days and just throw it up.

268
00:14:11,312 --> 00:14:15,152
You know, now people are getting
interested in these best before last day

269
00:14:15,152 --> 00:14:19,201
and then people are buying them more and
more because food is expensive, but we

270
00:14:19,321 --> 00:14:26,545
got to stop this wastage and selfishness
around food and extravagance around food.

271
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:27,321
Right?

272
00:14:29,181 --> 00:14:29,691
Yeah.

273
00:14:29,691 --> 00:14:33,711
That everything has to be fancy
that we eat, you know, that you

274
00:14:33,711 --> 00:14:37,461
can't eat rice and beans and
simple food and feel good about it.

275
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:42,095
Not that I eat that much rice and
beans, but at my age is not maybe

276
00:14:42,095 --> 00:14:43,315
the best food for me to be eating.

277
00:14:44,398 --> 00:14:49,393
And I'm very pissed about
bad health being the norm.

278
00:14:50,094 --> 00:14:50,294
No.

279
00:14:50,294 --> 00:14:58,901
I'm very pissed that of all the money that
comes into Ontario spent on healthcare.

280
00:14:59,321 --> 00:15:03,281
So if you had a family doing that,
let's say the family earned a hundred

281
00:15:03,281 --> 00:15:07,511
thousand dollars a year and they
spent 60,000 of it on healthcare.

282
00:15:08,321 --> 00:15:09,371
You say, well, what's wrong.

283
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:10,571
What's wrong with you?

284
00:15:10,751 --> 00:15:12,251
There's something wrong here.

285
00:15:12,752 --> 00:15:15,542
Why are you spending $60,000 in any base?

286
00:15:16,052 --> 00:15:19,202
Barely have money for food,
housing and everything else?

287
00:15:19,832 --> 00:15:25,322
Well, this is, this is our society
and the way we treat elders and in

288
00:15:25,322 --> 00:15:30,150
many ways, the way we treat children,
micro-managing them imprisoning them.

289
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,490
I think I'm against the norm of
society, the norms of society.

290
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,820
I think everyone liked the
norm and I hate the Cove norm.

291
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:43,757
I think it's a  bill of goods that has
been sold to people and the problem

292
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:49,127
coves spread because of inherent social
problems that we had before COVID started.

293
00:15:49,207 --> 00:15:51,877
It's like tuberculosis.

294
00:15:52,322 --> 00:15:55,983
There were social problems that
existed that spread to tuberculosis.

295
00:15:56,393 --> 00:16:02,393
Lack of proper housing damn
posing, cold housing, no heat.

296
00:16:03,743 --> 00:16:06,123
That's what spread tuberculosis.

297
00:16:06,477 --> 00:16:10,842
The way we treat our elders, the
way we treat immigrants, the way

298
00:16:10,842 --> 00:16:15,672
we treat people who worked in
factories, that's what spread.

299
00:16:15,822 --> 00:16:16,954
Oh, okay.

300
00:16:17,024 --> 00:16:20,374
The conditions by which we
force these people to live under

301
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:23,252
created a certain kind of outcome.

302
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:23,702
Okay.

303
00:16:24,572 --> 00:16:29,792
And also their immune system
being worn down from eating

304
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:31,442
crappy food, not taken by him.

305
00:16:31,442 --> 00:16:35,822
There's nobody ever wants on TV,
talked about keeping your immune

306
00:16:35,822 --> 00:16:38,192
system strong to prevent getting Cove.

307
00:16:38,943 --> 00:16:40,383
So what is a human being?

308
00:16:40,383 --> 00:16:42,693
What is our bottom line about being human?

309
00:16:43,792 --> 00:16:47,992
That's what, the questions that we
have to ask . So I'm a hypocrite.

310
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:56,028
I don't say my true feelings all the
time because I can't, but I do  with

311
00:16:56,028 --> 00:16:57,816
my staff . And they agree with me.

312
00:16:58,176 --> 00:16:59,196
I tell them, they're lucky.

313
00:16:59,256 --> 00:16:59,706
They're lucky.

314
00:16:59,706 --> 00:17:00,726
I'm not crazy.

315
00:17:01,446 --> 00:17:01,776
Okay.

316
00:17:01,776 --> 00:17:04,746
I remember in the height of Cove, I
went to the island with my girlfriend

317
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,206
and I put my purse on the ground.

318
00:17:07,536 --> 00:17:10,866
She says, don't, it could get cold.

319
00:17:10,926 --> 00:17:12,066
I've got a sidewalk.

320
00:17:12,396 --> 00:17:14,136
How was it going to live on a sidewalk?

321
00:17:14,136 --> 00:17:14,736
You tell me.

322
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:20,616
Anyway, so what is that time you is
telling you that there is this inherent

323
00:17:20,616 --> 00:17:25,856
fear that we've all been brought up
with that was there before COVID.

324
00:17:26,518 --> 00:17:28,148
Why was I not afraid?

325
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:29,678
Because I was very lucky.

326
00:17:29,678 --> 00:17:35,708
I was somewhat neglected and brought
up in laneways on a main street and the

327
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,468
1950s and sixties and allowed to run free.

328
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:44,018
And I had a father who was
a free spirit and a outlier.

329
00:17:44,468 --> 00:17:48,169
I didn't believe in the status
quo and taught me how to think.

330
00:17:48,815 --> 00:17:53,931
And the other thing is that we all
have to accept is nobody cares.

331
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,970
In the end, you better do it for
yourself because nobody's going to care.

332
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,070
They will try to care.

333
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,080
And when you seek help, you may get it.

334
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,620
But for your core life,
you better do a future.

335
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,370
You're saying society as a
whole doesn't care about you.

336
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,120
Yeah.

337
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,350
Like you have to take care of yourself.

338
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:18,490
Yeah, our society helps a little bit, but
they, with one hand they take it away.

339
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,810
And the other hand they give it to you.

340
00:18:20,193 --> 00:18:24,963
I feel like . Look at Rosano traveling
around the world in the last five years.

341
00:18:25,007 --> 00:18:27,407
You made the money to take
care of yourself to do it.

342
00:18:27,517 --> 00:18:29,767
You had your way of looking at the world.

343
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:33,697
You made your connections in
the way that you wanted to . you

344
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:36,487
didn't look to the government of
Canada to make it happen for you.

345
00:18:36,923 --> 00:18:42,560
I kind of feel like my situation was
a consequence of like the freedom that

346
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,250
I had to not live in society as it is.

347
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:51,845
But that is the gift of a middle-class
upbringing and an education.

348
00:18:53,085 --> 00:18:54,735
You did in the right way.

349
00:18:54,735 --> 00:18:58,545
And I did too in that we were
not particularly materialistic.

350
00:18:58,995 --> 00:19:04,515
So that's the real gift of a
civilized societies to give

351
00:19:04,515 --> 00:19:06,825
people individual freedom.

352
00:19:07,545 --> 00:19:13,185
We talk about that, but in fact, we're not
doing that because we're molding people

353
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:20,060
into consumers who value materialism and
are full of fear and they're not brave.

354
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,930
And they haven't gone out there in
the world and done it themselves

355
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:29,728
and created that really core
confidence and be ready to die.

356
00:19:30,648 --> 00:19:32,148
I don't give a shit if I die.

357
00:19:32,178 --> 00:19:37,531
I'm afraid of a bad accident and,
and having horrific injuries from a

358
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:39,721
bad accident, I'm not afraid to die.

359
00:19:40,501 --> 00:19:46,771
I could die to the world, so I've
lived my life, but I'm afraid if

360
00:19:46,771 --> 00:19:50,071
I had a horrible accident, that
would be much worse than dying.

361
00:19:52,921 --> 00:19:53,911
What are you afraid of?

362
00:19:57,611 --> 00:19:58,381
You think about that?

363
00:19:59,903 --> 00:20:02,813
I feel like I worry a lot, but
I don't know if that's because

364
00:20:02,813 --> 00:20:06,673
I'm afraid necessarily, or maybe
I'm just being paranoid, but like

365
00:20:06,693 --> 00:20:09,893
really genuinely fear full of stuff.

366
00:20:10,469 --> 00:20:11,399
What do you worry about?

367
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,429
I'm constantly, I don't know
this is going to work out.

368
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:17,799
I don't know if I have
enough money after the year.

369
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,139
I don't know what's going to happen
if I don't figure this thing out.

370
00:20:20,139 --> 00:20:21,489
I'm not going to have
to go on unemployment.

371
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:26,339
It's, it's actually, it's a lot of
materialistic things, maybe lower chakra.

372
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:28,589
It was lower chakra, very low chakra.

373
00:20:29,476 --> 00:20:31,546
within us, we have so much power.

374
00:20:32,536 --> 00:20:38,222
Our society is just so narrow considering,
but I have hope for the future.

375
00:20:38,222 --> 00:20:40,772
I have hope for younger people,
and I have hope for women.

376
00:20:41,162 --> 00:20:44,852
I think, you know, women are going
to come up really strong in a good.

377
00:20:45,707 --> 00:20:50,837
And men, you know, if the, if
the men are smart, they will too,

378
00:20:50,837 --> 00:20:55,397
but you know, men have been sold
a bill of goods, unfortunately,

379
00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:57,511
and are still believing in that.

380
00:20:57,951 --> 00:21:05,881
You should take a break, you know, let us
do the heavy lifting, take a break guys.

381
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:09,331
I think that, you know,
smart families did that.

382
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:10,361
You guys took a break.

383
00:21:11,281 --> 00:21:15,331
And these realizations, a part of what
you call the gift of getting older.

384
00:21:15,757 --> 00:21:21,115
You have hope all of a sudden or… oh, I
always was an optimistic person because

385
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:23,125
I've actually used so many things.

386
00:21:23,225 --> 00:21:24,995
I've made so many things happen.

387
00:21:24,995 --> 00:21:27,875
I mean, initiated 12,000 cultural events.

388
00:21:28,415 --> 00:21:29,765
And… Twelve thousand?

389
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:33,965
Yea that's what Free Times
has had 12,000 over 12,000.

390
00:21:34,025 --> 00:21:34,355
Right.

391
00:21:34,595 --> 00:21:39,785
I invented this fantastic brunch that
happened every week for 26 years.

392
00:21:40,325 --> 00:21:42,995
I had an art career,
I've done tons of art.

393
00:21:42,995 --> 00:21:48,213
And so I've done things, but I was that
type of person, you know, I did a lot of

394
00:21:48,213 --> 00:21:50,373
what I did because I was very unhappy.

395
00:21:50,373 --> 00:21:53,523
And if it didn't do
things,  I couldn't function.

396
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:57,353
You know, in today's where we just
drug people up, you just give them a

397
00:21:57,353 --> 00:22:02,003
tranquilizers and whatever, if they're
not unhappy and it, and it disables them.

398
00:22:02,003 --> 00:22:06,053
And that, that's also the core
of our problems, too many drugs.

399
00:22:06,386 --> 00:22:10,706
Not that I don't drink alcohol
and I don't have a puff, but it's

400
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:15,785
not like all day, every day, the
society just lets addiction go on.

401
00:22:15,815 --> 00:22:21,125
They let addiction go on until it's
it's total crisis where I've been

402
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:25,415
dealing with the core issue, which
is that we all love people be free.

403
00:22:26,498 --> 00:22:31,527
I'm happy to see marriages not
happening as frequently as they used to.

404
00:22:31,677 --> 00:22:32,457
It's a good thing.

405
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,882
Because as far as I'm concerned,
a marriage should be: what the

406
00:22:35,882 --> 00:22:40,682
five-year term you want the 10
year term five removed, renewable.

407
00:22:40,712 --> 00:22:40,892
Okay.

408
00:22:41,162 --> 00:22:41,552
Right.

409
00:22:42,392 --> 00:22:44,642
Should it be like, yeah,
like a mortgage, right?

410
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:47,991
This whole idea that you're going to
meet with one person for your whole

411
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:53,401
life creates happiness for some,
but a lot of distress for others.

412
00:22:54,451 --> 00:22:57,131
You might say removes freedom
for a bunch of people.

413
00:22:57,761 --> 00:23:02,053
Most people, think people think
there's something wrong with changing.

414
00:23:02,803 --> 00:23:07,383
To be free to change music, you have
to maybe admit that you made a mistake

415
00:23:07,383 --> 00:23:10,053
or something, but it's not a mistake.

416
00:23:10,303 --> 00:23:13,443
I think in the old days,
it was very hard to change.

417
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:17,853
People lived in this class based
society and you couldn't really

418
00:23:17,853 --> 00:23:21,273
move through the classes where you
were born, was really going to stay.

419
00:23:21,273 --> 00:23:25,900
And, I remember my brother telling
me in the middle ages, the average

420
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:30,910
person never went further than five
kilometers from where they were born.

421
00:23:31,463 --> 00:23:38,873
and Canada pre world war two was like
60, 70% rural farmers was a country

422
00:23:38,873 --> 00:23:44,423
full of farmers was, was, but still
is your, you know, your Canadians who

423
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,153
have roots for generations are farmers.

424
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:50,953
I want to ask you a little bit about
tech because I find it so curious

425
00:23:50,953 --> 00:23:54,759
that someone from your generation
just  seems to adapt so well to it.

426
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:57,549
And you have your contacts in your
iPhone, and you're always like

427
00:23:57,549 --> 00:23:59,319
calling people and use social media.

428
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:01,139
And we could talk about
your vine Starbucks.

429
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:01,319
I see.

430
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:05,969
That's the thing with me is that
I think I'm terrible attack now.

431
00:24:05,969 --> 00:24:06,719
How old are you again?

432
00:24:07,199 --> 00:24:08,429
71 71.

433
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:08,729
Okay.

434
00:24:09,629 --> 00:24:12,359
Took me two years to download an app.

435
00:24:14,189 --> 00:24:16,739
I was so afraid to download an app.

436
00:24:16,739 --> 00:24:17,609
I would never do it.

437
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:20,399
I still require help to do things.

438
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:20,639
Okay.

439
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:21,719
But I seek help.

440
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:22,949
This is the other thing.

441
00:24:22,949 --> 00:24:27,629
I understand how to process things
that you need people to teach you how

442
00:24:27,629 --> 00:24:32,339
to do things, but there's a learning
curve, but a lot of people think

443
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:35,009
that you should just be able to pick
it up and know how to do it yet.

444
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:38,969
But maybe from that generation of
my generation needs to be taught.

445
00:24:40,139 --> 00:24:44,279
And because it's not formalized
in our society is like

446
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:46,499
marriage and having children.

447
00:24:46,739 --> 00:24:50,729
And I found nobody's formally
taught how to use an iPhone.

448
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:53,579
So I'd have to say people who
use it, don't know how to use it.

449
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:56,969
Especially from my generation
where it's not intuitive.

450
00:24:57,889 --> 00:24:59,569
It's not just for your
generation, but sure.

451
00:24:59,599 --> 00:24:59,809
Yeah.

452
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:05,095
But I was also forced because
of the requirements of my work.

453
00:25:05,294 --> 00:25:08,704
I like it because it's so much easier,
but that's the thing , you enjoy it

454
00:25:08,704 --> 00:25:12,514
ultimately and you're, you're taking
to it and you find your own way to

455
00:25:12,514 --> 00:25:13,774
sort of express yourself through it.

456
00:25:13,774 --> 00:25:18,214
And it's not like, uh, uh, it's another
new thing I got to like, you, you embrace

457
00:25:18,214 --> 00:25:23,893
it more or less cause it's obviously like
a completely different social pattern.

458
00:25:23,893 --> 00:25:26,413
Like, um, I work with
wedding younger people.

459
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,010
So they'd teach me like you,

460
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,770
You are responsible for my vine stardom.

461
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:36,300
It's all your fault Rosano!

462
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:39,090
You were famous, you became a celebrity.

463
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,020
And that was my fault.

464
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,060
I take full you and Jessie.

465
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,230
It was totally random.

466
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,330
Remember you sitting across to me St.

467
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:48,900
Judy, I'm going to put this in
your phone, have some fun with it.

468
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:50,190
So I said, right.

469
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,000
Yeah.

470
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,340
Yeah.

471
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,110
It was you, you see the
power that you have.

472
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:56,310
Yeah.

473
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:56,940
It's interesting.

474
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,681
I mean, so you became, one of your
videos went viral totally by chance.

475
00:26:00,681 --> 00:26:05,211
And then you had this following
of like 10, 15,000 people.

476
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:06,051
Mostly like, yeah.

477
00:26:06,081 --> 00:26:06,861
I didn't try.

478
00:26:06,861 --> 00:26:08,751
If I had tried, I could've gotten away up.

479
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:09,831
Could have worked it.

480
00:26:09,831 --> 00:26:10,571
I never worked it.

481
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:14,770
I think a lot of people, if they
find that kind of success, they will

482
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,450
try to grip onto it for dear life.

483
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,900
And you're sort of like, you
know, vine isn't around anymore.

484
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,310
Fine is vine is gone.

485
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,410
Now maybe people who are listening
don't even know what vine is.

486
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,140
It used to be this, but she
knows that somebody actually

487
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,790
tattooed on their bum Judy.

488
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,860
Oh my gosh.

489
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,220
Yeah.

490
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:33,740
That's dedication the
dedication of your fans.

491
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,000
Yeah.

492
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,458
Most people would, would
want to like, keep it going.

493
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:39,578
And so now there's tic talk, which is
kind of the thing that would, when you

494
00:26:39,578 --> 00:26:41,468
used to do and you don't want to do that.

495
00:26:41,468 --> 00:26:44,778
You're like, no, well, I'm kind of done
with that part of my life and you're not.

496
00:26:44,778 --> 00:26:45,898
I don't feel like it.

497
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:48,518
And what, how do you
arrive at that conclusion?

498
00:26:48,818 --> 00:26:50,938
To not have even the curiosity?

499
00:26:50,938 --> 00:26:52,606
Because I'm onto other things.

500
00:26:52,606 --> 00:26:52,961
You're onto other things?

501
00:26:52,961 --> 00:26:56,558
I'd rather be on a dating app
and exploring that as characters

502
00:26:57,308 --> 00:26:58,688
and just move on to other things.

503
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:00,808
There's lots of other
things in this world.

504
00:27:00,808 --> 00:27:02,648
Why keep doing the same
thing over and over?

505
00:27:04,137 --> 00:27:09,957
my life is very varied and I worked
as varied and I'm not a hyper person.

506
00:27:09,957 --> 00:27:14,247
Like I don't have to be
doing things all the time.

507
00:27:14,637 --> 00:27:14,877
Right.

508
00:27:15,507 --> 00:27:20,667
I enjoy having two or three hours
a day of not doing anything much.

509
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:24,777
I let enjoy sitting, thinking
you actually sit and think.

510
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:29,787
Yeah, well, I enjoy thinking
more than anything really.

511
00:27:29,817 --> 00:27:32,517
And I talk a lot and I philosophize a lot.

512
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:38,367
A lot of people, Mike keeps, Mike
keeps track of Judaism's Judaism.

513
00:27:39,597 --> 00:27:40,227
I think.

514
00:27:40,257 --> 00:27:45,589
What do I think about, I think
about what's real and what isn't.

515
00:27:46,489 --> 00:27:46,939
What's real?

516
00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:48,079
Many things are real.

517
00:27:48,949 --> 00:27:52,819
I think about the things that don't
appear to be real, but really are real.

518
00:27:53,898 --> 00:27:54,318
Like?

519
00:27:55,078 --> 00:27:57,088
Just being in your physical self.

520
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:58,008
The body?

521
00:27:58,118 --> 00:27:59,498
The body and such.

522
00:27:59,925 --> 00:28:01,485
affection that's real.

523
00:28:02,762 --> 00:28:04,262
Loving Feelings are real.

524
00:28:04,869 --> 00:28:06,039
Food is real.

525
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:07,503
And What's not real?

526
00:28:07,713 --> 00:28:09,963
The suburbs, aren't real malls.

527
00:28:09,963 --> 00:28:10,833
Aren't real.

528
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,270
I have a hard time with all that stuff.

529
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,200
Why aren't they real?

530
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,840
Cause they're a construct.

531
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,110
They're an artificial
materialistic construct.

532
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,270
I have a hard time with them.

533
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,070
I have a lot of moralism around it.

534
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:27,772
It seems like it's just, people
well know that there is kind of

535
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:31,822
a kind of a goal I guess, bombed
behind, but I don't like the suburbs.

536
00:28:32,782 --> 00:28:38,512
I think dehumanizes people and not to
say that there aren't real and good

537
00:28:38,512 --> 00:28:42,982
and interesting people who live in the
suburbs, but I think most of them would

538
00:28:42,982 --> 00:28:44,902
rather not be living in the suburbs.

539
00:28:45,032 --> 00:28:47,542
They do that because they
don't have other options.

540
00:28:47,542 --> 00:28:48,492
It's not a choice, right.

541
00:28:48,732 --> 00:28:49,402
It's not a choice.

542
00:28:49,402 --> 00:28:50,542
Especially immigrants.

543
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:56,084
Most of the centers are started by
immigrants, most would rather live in

544
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:58,244
a livable city where they came from.

545
00:28:59,564 --> 00:29:06,154
But unfortunately that part of their lives
has been destroyed because some dominant

546
00:29:06,458 --> 00:29:10,448
country made war and they became refugees.

547
00:29:10,734 --> 00:29:11,754
It's not a good thing.

548
00:29:12,114 --> 00:29:12,924
It's an awful thing.

549
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:18,000
All of this reflection on what's real.

550
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,140
And what's not real.

551
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:22,410
You think about it within
yourself, I'm guessing.

552
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:25,800
But, you mentioned once, like
wanting to start a therapy

553
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,540
practice to like help other people.

554
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,260
So you want to also like bring this
out to other people and help them

555
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:35,340
realize, like, how do you see your,
how do you imagine yourself doing that?

556
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,280
Well, you know, like a lot of things
I've done in my life, my life in

557
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,290
many ways has been very random.

558
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,630
It's like a vine.

559
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:51,260
Like I, I only see it really happening in
a situation like I was needed to do it.

560
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:55,250
Well, you can get a business card and
have a shtick and be like, no, it's

561
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,190
just, I do it with people anyways.

562
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,420
Like I do it with my staff.

563
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,180
I give them these front characters
that they can hide behind

564
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:07,880
and you know, they feel a lot
better about their insecurities.

565
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,770
Can you give some examples?

566
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,570
Well, you know, I'm Ms.

567
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,190
Critical, critical.

568
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:13,640
Yeah.

569
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,620
Tiffany is Ms.

570
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,520
Overconfident.

571
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:16,950
Mike's.

572
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,250
Mr.

573
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,550
Nice guy, Ravi is Mr.

574
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,420
Do it myself, Sandra.

575
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:21,960
And is Mr.

576
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,560
Speedo?

577
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,200
Katie is Ms.

578
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:30,197
Apologetic,  when we're stressed,
we go to these characters that

579
00:30:30,197 --> 00:30:32,147
are not always our best selves.

580
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:36,873
So when our not so best selves
come out, we can say, it's this

581
00:30:36,873 --> 00:30:38,283
other self that's doing it.

582
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:40,823
We don't have to identify,
be a little more forgiving.

583
00:30:41,123 --> 00:30:44,183
We don't have to identify our
wholesales and the staff have

584
00:30:44,183 --> 00:30:45,893
found that really helpful.

585
00:30:46,713 --> 00:30:50,543
Your stuff finds it helpful because
they can check in on and I'll say

586
00:30:50,553 --> 00:30:55,143
that to Tiffany in it potentially
stressing situation, I'll say how's Ms.

587
00:30:55,143 --> 00:30:56,433
Overconfident.

588
00:30:56,863 --> 00:30:59,893
Is she bothering you or is
she, you know, taking over?

589
00:31:00,013 --> 00:31:01,993
Oh no, Judy, I think she's under control.

590
00:31:02,143 --> 00:31:07,213
And what is Rosano's cover?

591
00:31:07,363 --> 00:31:08,623
And how many do I have?

592
00:31:09,343 --> 00:31:15,793
Oh, maybe one in every country
you go to that's lovely, shy guy.

593
00:31:16,483 --> 00:31:16,783
Mr.

594
00:31:16,783 --> 00:31:17,563
Shy guy.

595
00:31:18,246 --> 00:31:20,586
I'm I'm less shy than I was.

596
00:31:20,706 --> 00:31:22,686
So he's kind of going way.

597
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:26,962
what's the name for the person
who's thinking of the, think

598
00:31:26,962 --> 00:31:28,402
he thinks of you in the head.

599
00:31:29,538 --> 00:31:35,358
well, yeah, you're reborn, but you all,
it's hard for you to gain presence.

600
00:31:35,418 --> 00:31:36,408
Oh, okay.

601
00:31:36,408 --> 00:31:37,578
So Mr.

602
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:40,711
I'm not here you're kind of like Mr.

603
00:31:40,711 --> 00:31:46,459
I'm not here when stressed, you know,
like you disappear, So that's also why

604
00:31:46,459 --> 00:31:51,979
you move from country to country because
like, you know, disappearing and moving

605
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,349
to another place and then reestablishing
yourself and then kind of disappear

606
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:59,359
and you're, but you are very spiritual.

607
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:02,149
You do flow on this magic carpet.

608
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:04,309
I think you're an amazing person.

609
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:07,592
I really do, but you're still reacting.

610
00:32:08,619 --> 00:32:12,639
You're still not completely yourself,
but you're getting there for your age.

611
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:13,599
You're doing really well.

612
00:32:14,069 --> 00:32:15,429
Thank you, that's very generous.

613
00:32:15,459 --> 00:32:16,319
Yeah, yeah.

614
00:32:16,766 --> 00:32:17,246
Mr.

615
00:32:17,246 --> 00:32:20,186
Disappearing is always
happy when he is grounded.

616
00:32:20,186 --> 00:32:21,326
So he needs grounding.

617
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:22,196
Okay.

618
00:32:22,466 --> 00:32:23,066
I love this.

619
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:26,366
And I'm wondering if it works in
the other direction also where the

620
00:32:26,366 --> 00:32:28,076
thing that you want to be has a name.

621
00:32:28,886 --> 00:32:30,446
So that's a good one.

622
00:32:30,476 --> 00:32:32,096
It would be Mr.

623
00:32:32,611 --> 00:32:33,111
B here.

624
00:32:33,121 --> 00:32:37,351
Now something like the sir or well,
for each of your staff or whoever.

625
00:32:37,401 --> 00:32:40,311
You know what, I think
what you want to be Mr.

626
00:32:40,311 --> 00:32:40,881
Lover?

627
00:32:41,031 --> 00:32:41,721
I could be Mr.

628
00:32:41,721 --> 00:32:42,021
Lover.

629
00:32:42,801 --> 00:32:44,091
I could, I could want to be Mr.

630
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:44,301
Lover.

631
00:32:44,691 --> 00:32:47,241
I think that's what you are
that you want to be, you know,

632
00:32:47,361 --> 00:32:49,861
a lover, in your body lover.

633
00:32:49,891 --> 00:32:52,231
I think I want to be Ms.

634
00:32:52,561 --> 00:32:55,471
Not nice guy, but be a
nice person all the time.

635
00:32:55,771 --> 00:32:56,251
Really?

636
00:32:56,491 --> 00:32:59,791
You want to be that that's shocking to me.

637
00:32:59,791 --> 00:33:02,851
Cause I thought you would have been
sick of that or you deliberately try

638
00:33:02,851 --> 00:33:05,671
not to do that because you've targeted,
like trying to please other people

639
00:33:05,671 --> 00:33:07,501
or something, but you want that.

640
00:33:08,401 --> 00:33:08,851
Yeah.

641
00:33:08,851 --> 00:33:10,471
I'd like to be at peace.

642
00:33:10,501 --> 00:33:10,771
Ms.

643
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:11,731
Peaceful, maybe.

644
00:33:11,816 --> 00:33:15,086
Nice guy, but in a real
way, be kind to people.

645
00:33:15,086 --> 00:33:19,086
I find it sometime really hard
to be kind I have the sharp wit.

646
00:33:19,196 --> 00:33:24,836
I know it has not been easy for you to
be out there in the world on your own,

647
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:28,816
maybe worried about the next dollar
that you're going to make, or where

648
00:33:28,816 --> 00:33:32,416
are you going to sleep that night or
whatever, putting yourself out there.

649
00:33:32,616 --> 00:33:35,416
But you knew that you had to
do that because if you didn't

650
00:33:35,416 --> 00:33:39,036
do it, the consequences were
worse than the other direction.

651
00:33:39,096 --> 00:33:42,996
And what were the consequences
going to be mental health issues.

652
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:47,700
You had to fight for your life in a
different way because the society tries

653
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,250
to take it away from you in every term.

654
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:53,135
Somehow you were given that strength.

655
00:33:53,285 --> 00:33:59,765
Like I was to be able to do that and
say, no, I'm not going to have this free

656
00:33:59,765 --> 00:34:05,005
conscribed life or work for the man worked
for the company and, you know, work on my

657
00:34:05,005 --> 00:34:07,375
computer from home and never go anywhere.

658
00:34:07,758 --> 00:34:07,968
Yeah.

659
00:34:07,968 --> 00:34:11,868
I was encouraged by a good friend of mine.

660
00:34:11,868 --> 00:34:12,318
He was doing.

661
00:34:13,293 --> 00:34:16,863
Pushing me to like buy one of those
backpacks that I can just keep everything

662
00:34:16,863 --> 00:34:19,623
in there and I don't have to hold
anything in my hand and I can walk around.

663
00:34:20,053 --> 00:34:24,153
It took him  few years maybe of trying
to prod me to try traveling out.

664
00:34:24,203 --> 00:34:27,143
It was very recently, but
it happened because of

665
00:34:27,143 --> 00:34:28,433
encouragement of people that came.

666
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:32,093
And also people like yourself,
encourage me to do my own thing, be

667
00:34:32,093 --> 00:34:33,913
myself, so to speak , these cliches.

668
00:34:33,943 --> 00:34:40,183
But it's meant a lot of , very
profound experiences for me.

669
00:34:40,183 --> 00:34:45,733
And I've learned a lot about myself
and I've had a kind of life that

670
00:34:46,183 --> 00:34:47,413
not a lot of people get to have.

671
00:34:47,413 --> 00:34:49,183
And so I'm super grateful about that.

672
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,720
but yeah, I, I don't feel, I can
totally take credit for that.

673
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,970
I did put in the work and I did do it,
but , I also just want to acknowledge

674
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,350
like the people that, oh yeah.

675
00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:00,680
I mean, it's the same with me too,
because all the thousands of wonderful

676
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:05,990
people I've met and worked with, but
ultimately you're the center of it.

677
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,790
And you're the center of your world.

678
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,620
You're the one who pushes the button.

679
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,670
That's why I'm saying, that's
why I say, nobody cares.

680
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,810
You got to do it.

681
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,029
That's what I mean by that.

682
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:22,050
And then ultimately it's your
decision whether you do or you don't

683
00:35:22,696 --> 00:35:25,816
. 
Our society is a very
sick oriented society.

684
00:35:26,071 --> 00:35:31,601
We use sickness as a cop-out that's
always the reason not to do, oh,

685
00:35:31,601 --> 00:35:35,885
I'm this I'm that .  When we get
sick as a reason not to do not

686
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:39,275
to love, be disappointed in love.

687
00:35:39,275 --> 00:35:40,205
So you get sick.

688
00:35:40,565 --> 00:35:41,525
Sometimes you die.

689
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:48,080
Not to fight against what your parents
want . So you get sick, you get depressed.

690
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,600
Your will is broken.

691
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:54,590
The best thing a parent could do for
their child is not to break their will.

692
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:00,640
We're born with a will, but it can be
broken and society is there to break it.

693
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:09,216
That's actually, unfortunately the, dark
side of society is to break our Wells so

694
00:36:09,216 --> 00:36:11,376
that we do what society wants us to do.

695
00:36:11,726 --> 00:36:14,876
Why do you think people get
taken in by these scammers?

696
00:36:15,056 --> 00:36:15,416
Wow.

697
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:17,246
This was the CRA a calling.

698
00:36:17,736 --> 00:36:22,806
They told me that I had a package
of illegal things and that

699
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:23,976
it was going to be arrested.

700
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:24,816
Right.

701
00:36:26,196 --> 00:36:27,426
Do you know what I say to them?

702
00:36:27,546 --> 00:36:29,646
Because I always go to the number one.

703
00:36:29,706 --> 00:36:30,216
So the answer.

704
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:31,866
And the citizen.

705
00:36:32,136 --> 00:36:37,926
Does your mother know that
you're a scammer is not the best?

706
00:36:37,956 --> 00:36:39,366
And how did they respond to that?

707
00:36:39,456 --> 00:36:45,136
Usually they hang up at one
time, a woman said, no, well

708
00:36:45,156 --> 00:36:46,596
said, well, you should tell her.

709
00:36:47,046 --> 00:36:48,366
She should know what you're doing.

710
00:36:49,456 --> 00:36:51,586
How you cheating Canadians
out of their money.

711
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:52,599
And I hung up.

712
00:36:53,899 --> 00:36:57,499
I'm trying to imagine what it's like
for them to treat them as human beings.

713
00:36:57,499 --> 00:36:58,519
They are human beings.

714
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,029
They are.

715
00:36:59,029 --> 00:36:59,479
Yes.

716
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:02,629
But, and it's almost that it's, that
you've actually like for one you've

717
00:37:02,629 --> 00:37:07,999
acknowledged her humanity, which she's
probably not, she's literally, uh, well

718
00:37:08,029 --> 00:37:11,209
presenting themselves as bots or robots
or whatever, but then also to just

719
00:37:11,209 --> 00:37:15,379
like to come into her situation there,
which no nobody's going to do that.

720
00:37:15,379 --> 00:37:18,229
So I'm, I'm trying to put myself in
that person's shoes, just like, what's

721
00:37:18,229 --> 00:37:22,279
it like to receive that from, from
Judy, from, you know, from somebody

722
00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:28,459
in north America, will we need to
confront them on a human level that

723
00:37:28,459 --> 00:37:30,529
these are people that they're calling.

724
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:37,449
We are not just stick figures on our money
is not there because it was given to us.

725
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:41,969
Is that easy for you to
just speak to somebody?

726
00:37:43,769 --> 00:37:49,619
Very easy, because I think, and I can
also be really nasty on the phone when,

727
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:51,939
when these places call at the restaurant.

728
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:53,811
I'll say, Nope, the owner died.

729
00:37:54,321 --> 00:37:57,411
We're just folding up the
restaurant now kind of story.

730
00:37:59,303 --> 00:38:01,303
But I mostly get to the mother thing,

731
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,920
and how do you know that that's a thing?

732
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:07,950
Cause I know it's a thing,
especially with third world

733
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,570
people, a mother is everything.

734
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,540
Mother is the judge of the morality.

735
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:17,980
The keeper or the morals of the
family is really the mother more than

736
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:21,520
the father in terms of their child.

737
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:26,070
I think the father keeps the
morals of the outside world, but

738
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:31,319
the mother really keeps the family
morals in bringing up the child.

739
00:38:31,569 --> 00:38:36,789
The kid on a daily basis has to deal
with the mother on the big issues.

740
00:38:36,789 --> 00:38:41,409
Maybe the father, but on the daily
basis, the mother knows what's going on.

741
00:38:41,722 --> 00:38:44,842
What would it sound like if I said,
does your father know what you're doing?

742
00:38:45,592 --> 00:38:47,362
Does your mother know what you're doing?

743
00:38:48,172 --> 00:38:49,012
What's the difference?

744
00:38:49,172 --> 00:38:51,122
Does your mother know you're a scammer?

745
00:38:51,332 --> 00:38:53,282
Does your father know you're a scammer?

746
00:38:53,342 --> 00:38:54,272
What sounds worse?

747
00:38:54,462 --> 00:38:56,202
To me anyway, it feels more emotional.

748
00:38:56,262 --> 00:38:56,922
Yeah.

749
00:38:56,982 --> 00:38:58,182
It's more emotional.

750
00:38:58,182 --> 00:39:02,322
Canadians don't have the same quite
strong relationship with the mother.

751
00:39:02,322 --> 00:39:07,812
And also the power of women in the family
is not as respected in Canadian cultures.

752
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:12,222
It doesn't, let's say Sri Lankan
culture or Indian culture.

753
00:39:12,672 --> 00:39:13,122
Right.

754
00:39:13,422 --> 00:39:15,666
The mother the boss, right?

755
00:39:15,696 --> 00:39:16,746
Chinese.

756
00:39:17,376 --> 00:39:20,286
See, we have diminished
the matriarchal here.

757
00:39:20,976 --> 00:39:25,012
It's part of our problem, That's why
we have to have women's lib, because

758
00:39:25,052 --> 00:39:27,462
we so weaken women into  nothingness.

759
00:39:28,011 --> 00:39:30,441
put them in the suburbs to
give anything away from them.

760
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:32,841
And they didn't even have to cook anymore.

761
00:39:32,841 --> 00:39:38,087
Just open up packages and then took
all the power, which is terrible.

762
00:39:39,727 --> 00:39:40,687
Well, when you put it like that.

763
00:39:41,505 --> 00:39:42,855
Are you recording all this one?

764
00:39:42,855 --> 00:39:43,605
My God.

765
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:44,265
That's great.

766
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,235
Don't tell them.

767
00:39:47,235 --> 00:39:49,785
It's me tell them it's somebody else.

768
00:39:52,665 --> 00:39:57,435
Judy recorded this, play it.

769
00:39:57,435 --> 00:39:59,775
When I croak, just come to my funeral.

770
00:39:59,805 --> 00:40:01,395
Everybody who's listening to this.

771
00:40:01,395 --> 00:40:03,015
You're invited to my funeral.

772
00:40:03,765 --> 00:40:04,785
I'm 71.

773
00:40:04,785 --> 00:40:08,955
I'm gonna live to be 102 to 31 years.

774
00:40:09,285 --> 00:40:10,275
Come to my funeral.

775
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:17,205
I need 10,000 people and it's going to
be a big party and I'm going to be thrown

776
00:40:17,205 --> 00:40:20,235
into the ocean in a mermaid cop coffin.

777
00:40:20,475 --> 00:40:21,975
I'm going out like a mermaid.

778
00:40:22,435 --> 00:40:23,935
I'm not going to be buried in the ground.

779
00:40:24,175 --> 00:40:27,385
I went to a funeral last year and
I saw the cold or this little,

780
00:40:27,805 --> 00:40:32,265
you know, this little  piece,
so small and just stuck in it.

781
00:40:33,075 --> 00:40:34,125
Who wants to be there?

782
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:35,625
I don't want to be in the ocean.

783
00:40:36,105 --> 00:40:37,065
It's taken me away.

784
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,470
Take me away.

785
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:41,170
Did you get that idea from somewhere?

786
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:43,420
Is that your creative thing?

787
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,440
I was a scuba diver.

788
00:40:45,768 --> 00:40:50,808
So I have experienced the underwater
and, and also some of the most  extent

789
00:40:50,808 --> 00:40:53,058
at times of my life underwater.

790
00:40:53,148 --> 00:40:58,698
And because I've been swimming every
week for like 45 years, I have a strong

791
00:40:58,698 --> 00:41:03,778
relationship with the water and I saw a
movie on women who want to be mermaids,

792
00:41:04,168 --> 00:41:08,758
who mermaid costumes and go down to
the beach and lie on the sand and their

793
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:13,468
mermaid costumes, which I'm hoping to
be able to do at some point in my life.

794
00:41:14,548 --> 00:41:16,198
So why not?

795
00:41:16,258 --> 00:41:16,588
Right.

796
00:41:17,161 --> 00:41:21,481
I think my generation is going to
have very creative funerals and I'd

797
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:26,611
say that a good business to get into
would be deterred shaped coffins.

798
00:41:27,811 --> 00:41:31,261
I heard a chair first get in on
the ground floor guitar shaped

799
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:33,931
coffins, or shaped coffins, right?

800
00:41:34,531 --> 00:41:38,581
I'd say half the men in my generation are
going to want to be buried in a guitar

801
00:41:39,391 --> 00:41:41,221
because of the electric guitar fender.

802
00:41:41,461 --> 00:41:43,801
They all see themselves as artists.

803
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:47,441
I've been exploring the feminine,
the masculine what's the feminine

804
00:41:47,441 --> 00:41:51,331
about feminine's very beautiful,
very deep, so it's masculine.

805
00:41:51,381 --> 00:41:54,471
but you know, we all have
both sides to ourselves.

806
00:41:54,661 --> 00:42:01,948
We need not be afraid of those sides,
but I also know that we do gain our

807
00:42:01,948 --> 00:42:05,778
main orientation from the opposite sex.

808
00:42:06,137 --> 00:42:11,587
women, gain their deep femininity
from men and men gain their

809
00:42:11,587 --> 00:42:13,537
deep masculinity from women.

810
00:42:13,782 --> 00:42:19,252
from a relationship with a woman,
you will get the feeling of being

811
00:42:19,252 --> 00:42:21,112
a man, not from another man.

812
00:42:21,722 --> 00:42:24,992
The deep feeling of being a
man, you will get a surface.

813
00:42:25,052 --> 00:42:28,052
Let's say the father gets
you to join a team sport.

814
00:42:28,302 --> 00:42:28,712
Okay.

815
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,032
I'm one of the boys.

816
00:42:30,062 --> 00:42:33,422
And then the team, that's
like a surface man, but the

817
00:42:33,422 --> 00:42:35,732
deep man comes from the woman.

818
00:42:36,282 --> 00:42:46,520
What's a deep Deep man is the
man who pleases a woman who truly

819
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,410
pleases a woman is a deep man.

820
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:55,030
And the deep woman is the
one who can be pleased.

821
00:42:55,510 --> 00:43:01,120
The one who can be pleased can be
pleased Who let's the man please her.

822
00:43:02,033 --> 00:43:02,243
Ms.

823
00:43:02,243 --> 00:43:07,925
Surrenders gives herself the
permission to enjoy it's right.

824
00:43:07,955 --> 00:43:10,265
I think that's what
all sexuality is about.

825
00:43:10,265 --> 00:43:15,345
Is it though surrendering
and dominating surrendering?

826
00:43:15,787 --> 00:43:20,287
Unfortunately in our society
is so repressed that it comes

827
00:43:20,287 --> 00:43:21,877
out in a lot of pornography.

828
00:43:22,548 --> 00:43:24,971
which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

829
00:43:24,971 --> 00:43:28,391
It's only a bad thing
because it becomes obsessive.

830
00:43:28,654 --> 00:43:33,094
That's actually a big illness in
our society because people's natural

831
00:43:33,094 --> 00:43:37,989
sexuality has been denied that it's
not interwoven into our ceremonies and

832
00:43:37,989 --> 00:43:40,719
mentor, social being, it's kind of hidden.

833
00:43:41,629 --> 00:43:43,409
It's always like the dark side.

834
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:44,439
Clandestine?

835
00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:45,019
Yeah.

836
00:43:45,379 --> 00:43:46,239
Have you watched Goop?

837
00:43:46,989 --> 00:43:47,209
Goop?

838
00:43:47,939 --> 00:43:51,424
The Gwyneth Paltrow documentary
dynamometry or it's like a

839
00:43:51,424 --> 00:43:53,464
Netflix series about sex.

840
00:43:53,687 --> 00:43:56,597
A bunch of different couples come
together and Gwyneth Paltrow is going to

841
00:43:56,867 --> 00:44:00,167
put them together with a therapist and
they're going to try and improve each

842
00:44:00,167 --> 00:44:02,597
couple's sex life in a different way.

843
00:44:02,597 --> 00:44:04,937
Cause it's a couple of different
issues that they're struggling with.

844
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:07,240
It's a lot of relationship with body.

845
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:11,300
Healthier relationships towards
the body towards sexuality.

846
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:15,930
They even had an elderly couple there,
sort of a taboo thing or something elderly

847
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:18,540
in their mind, they use the word elderly.

848
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:29,178
Um, but those people were maybe in their
sixties or seventies, so they used the

849
00:44:29,178 --> 00:44:35,028
word elderly, Rosa, I consider you mature.

850
00:44:35,058 --> 00:44:40,818
I consider you an elder elder,
but not elderly elder though.

851
00:44:40,848 --> 00:44:42,798
No, I consider you young actually.

852
00:44:43,088 --> 00:44:45,138
You're, you're quite useful, you know?

853
00:44:45,732 --> 00:44:50,325
you ride a bike and you got a hula hoop
thing going sometimes, and you're a hippie

854
00:44:50,325 --> 00:44:54,045
and then you leave your door unlocked
and you put your, but I still don't lock.

855
00:44:54,095 --> 00:44:54,885
You don't lock your door.

856
00:44:54,885 --> 00:44:58,485
You have just, don't tell them where
I, I won't tell anybody I do it.

857
00:44:58,515 --> 00:45:04,005
I only do it when, like, I go away, you
know, like going out to town or something,

858
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,385
but that doesn't happen too often.

859
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:09,420
Or if there's workmen around, you know,
like if there's people around and it

860
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:12,330
was a low strangest around, I will walk.

861
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:12,570
Yeah.

862
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,520
There's people   who don't
live here essentially.

863
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:14,580
Yeah.

864
00:45:14,883 --> 00:45:16,363
I just don't want to lock my door.

865
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:18,523
I don't want to get
locked out of my own home.

866
00:45:19,363 --> 00:45:20,473
Isn't that crazy?

867
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:23,603
It seems like there's this parallel
between the coffin, like not

868
00:45:23,603 --> 00:45:26,693
being, wanting to be in a box and
locked in a box around freedom.

869
00:45:26,693 --> 00:45:27,143
My total.

870
00:45:27,803 --> 00:45:27,953
Yeah.

871
00:45:28,433 --> 00:45:35,843
I'm always doing practices of
liberation, liberation, and also true.

872
00:45:37,793 --> 00:45:40,163
We need to practice these things.

873
00:45:41,303 --> 00:45:44,973
We need to put ourselves in a
situation where we might lose and

874
00:45:44,993 --> 00:45:47,403
see what happens you certainly have.

875
00:45:48,005 --> 00:45:49,285
And how has that matured you?

876
00:45:50,095 --> 00:45:52,245
Oh, uh, it's been fantastic.

877
00:45:52,785 --> 00:45:53,865
I wouldn't trade it for anything.

878
00:45:55,147 --> 00:46:02,031
if you'd stayed in the normal society, you
wouldn't have gained all this insight and

879
00:46:02,031 --> 00:46:04,491
confidence that you've gotten from Lucy.

880
00:46:04,551 --> 00:46:05,001
Right.

881
00:46:05,031 --> 00:46:06,681
You've had things stolen from you.

882
00:46:06,821 --> 00:46:07,061
Actually.

883
00:46:07,061 --> 00:46:08,901
I haven't, I haven't been
pretty lucky in that.

884
00:46:08,901 --> 00:46:16,701
I haven't really had much to say except
from the police, but, um, but other

885
00:46:16,701 --> 00:46:20,197
than that, no, I mean, I've, I've
surprised myself because I'm sort of new

886
00:46:20,197 --> 00:46:25,247
to traveling and this idea of staying
in  strangers' homes and, uh, whether

887
00:46:25,247 --> 00:46:28,067
it's Airbnb or couch surfing or friend
of a friend or whatever, but like,

888
00:46:28,097 --> 00:46:32,147
I've always just trusted the person
and I've never like, lost anything.

889
00:46:32,147 --> 00:46:33,977
So I've been really fortunate
in that respect for it.

890
00:46:34,577 --> 00:46:36,747
And I've stayed in like a
lot of other people's places.

891
00:46:37,235 --> 00:46:40,435
it's like almost something should've
happened by now, but, um, no, I mean, I

892
00:46:40,435 --> 00:46:45,235
I've been very fortunate, but also there's
so much to be gained from just accepting

893
00:46:45,235 --> 00:46:47,025
that good things happen from randomness.

894
00:46:47,025 --> 00:46:48,735
Like you can't always control everything.

895
00:46:48,735 --> 00:46:52,085
I think, you know, we say we don't
want to take the risk, but what is

896
00:46:52,085 --> 00:46:59,035
the risk on the other side in terms of
your social self and your soul self.

897
00:47:00,145 --> 00:47:05,515
I want to ask you another thing
about tech cause again, I find it

898
00:47:05,515 --> 00:47:10,165
so curious that someone from your
era is in this present today, which

899
00:47:10,165 --> 00:47:13,525
is so hyper-connected and mobile.

900
00:47:13,715 --> 00:47:18,595
Is there something you wish people
would carry over from like the older

901
00:47:18,685 --> 00:47:21,595
kinds of media that you grew up with?

902
00:47:21,645 --> 00:47:23,655
I don't know, TV, radio,
newspaper, whatever.

903
00:47:23,705 --> 00:47:28,265
Because now we have all these new patterns
and it's very fast and very instantaneous.

904
00:47:28,315 --> 00:47:34,125
Is there something  from  older technology
that you would like to see represented?

905
00:47:35,317 --> 00:47:40,367
Oh, well, I think of new technology
more than old, my fantasy is that

906
00:47:40,367 --> 00:47:44,957
we'll have chips implanted in
our fingers for various things.

907
00:47:44,957 --> 00:47:50,527
And one of them is going to be our
computer implant and that we touched

908
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:53,357
the table and that becomes so computer.

909
00:47:53,818 --> 00:47:57,357
So you're looking more into the
future and you want to see this?

910
00:47:57,717 --> 00:48:00,327
I told all the old stuff
is already in there.

911
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:01,047
Isn't it?

912
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:03,447
I mean, you have, this is a podcast radio.

913
00:48:03,627 --> 00:48:07,167
Well, I'm not actually asking, I'm
not asking about the technology.

914
00:48:08,157 --> 00:48:14,007
I mean like the way you would interact
with people, maybe there are certain

915
00:48:14,007 --> 00:48:18,597
ways of interacting with people that are
maybe no longer present and maybe that

916
00:48:18,597 --> 00:48:22,857
could have been good or maybe not, you
know, and maybe the way we do things

917
00:48:22,857 --> 00:48:30,557
now, sort of asynchronously and short
messages and or not handwritten or not.

918
00:48:30,627 --> 00:48:31,617
Do you miss anything?

919
00:48:32,817 --> 00:48:37,647
I think the ways of communicating
now are so varied and exciting.

920
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:39,087
I think it's fantastic.

921
00:48:39,447 --> 00:48:42,747
Like all communicate with
different people in different ways.

922
00:48:42,807 --> 00:48:49,337
It's excitement, instant messaging,
WhatsApp, texting, telephone.

923
00:48:49,337 --> 00:48:49,847
Audio message.

924
00:48:49,847 --> 00:48:54,571
FaceTime, face time,
audio message pictures.

925
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:56,251
So it's exciting for you.

926
00:48:56,251 --> 00:48:57,031
It's stimulating.

927
00:48:57,061 --> 00:48:57,931
Very exciting.

928
00:48:57,981 --> 00:49:03,051
But I think the hardware it's tricky
because you don't want to lose your phone.

929
00:49:03,081 --> 00:49:03,381
Right.

930
00:49:03,771 --> 00:49:06,741
I think we, we, we need to
have chips embedded in us.

931
00:49:07,191 --> 00:49:09,201
I don't want to have keys anymore.

932
00:49:09,741 --> 00:49:12,471
I don't want to have hardware anymore.

933
00:49:12,471 --> 00:49:16,221
We should have it in us and we've touched
surfaces and that becomes our hardware.

934
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:16,791
Wow.

935
00:49:18,827 --> 00:49:19,877
I'm not even there yet.

936
00:49:20,477 --> 00:49:22,097
I need, that's just my fantasy.

937
00:49:22,097 --> 00:49:23,837
How that could actually happen.

938
00:49:24,377 --> 00:49:26,267
Oh, I don't doubt that
that's going to happen.

939
00:49:26,267 --> 00:49:28,037
I mean, I think that's totally reasonable.

940
00:49:28,271 --> 00:49:30,131
Where can people find out
more about what you're doing?

941
00:49:34,181 --> 00:49:37,181
What's your free times come to the
free times, restaurant three 20

942
00:49:37,181 --> 00:49:40,421
colors street, Toronto, two free times

943
00:49:40,871 --> 00:49:41,921
Anything else you want to mention?

944
00:49:42,353 --> 00:49:47,573
okay, so this is my advice to all of
you, the three prong approach to problem

945
00:49:47,573 --> 00:49:55,343
solving delay, as long as possible, get
more information, get more information,

946
00:49:55,373 --> 00:49:57,713
look where you are for the answer.

947
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:02,293
It's usually right in front of you.

948
00:50:03,683 --> 00:50:04,163
Amazing.

949
00:50:04,193 --> 00:50:05,863
Thanks so much for being with me Judy.

950
00:50:05,863 --> 00:50:06,483
Namaste.

951
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:07,773
Namaste.

952
00:50:12,287 --> 00:50:15,674
That was my extended conversation
with Judy Perly on the

953
00:50:15,674 --> 00:50:17,024
